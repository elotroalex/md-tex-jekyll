Two others oped their iron jaws,
And waved their children-stealing paws;
There sat their children in gewgaws;
    By stinting negroes' backs and maws,
    They kept up heavenly union.

All good from Jack another takes,
And entertains their flirts and rakes,
Who dress as sleek as glossy snakes,
    And cram their mouths with sweetened cakes;
    And this goes down for union.
