abstract: "Caribbean cyberfeminisms are diverse, heterogeneous, and polyvocal. Networks may be simultaneously national, regional, global, transnational, and diasporic. Through practices of media creation, curating, (re)blogging, (re)tweeting, sharing, and commenting across multiple social media platforms, Caribbean feminist knit together an online community that is often linked to on-the-ground organizing and action. Online feminist practices are therefore rich archives for the study of Caribbean feminisms. To date, scholarly work on women's and feminist movements in the region has failed to document and analyze these practices and sites of activism. Similarly, Caribbean feminist critiques of technology and new media are not well developed. The essay attends to this gap by offering a partial and preliminary mapping Caribbean cyberfeminisms primarily through documentation and analysis of Caribbean feminist blogs."

The murder of Japanese pannist Asami Nagakiya at Trinidad and Tobago's
carnival generated international headlines. The mayor of Port of Spain,
Raymond Tim Kee, seemed to blame Nagakiya for her own death, couching
the violence against her as a result of "vulgarity and lewdness in
conduct," underscoring that "women have a responsibility to ensure they
are not abused."[^1] Trinidadian women (and men) assembled outside City
Hall to demand the mayor's resignation. They also shifted the public
conversation on gender-based violence away from what they deemed
"victim-blaming" and "slut-shaming" toward one of state accountability
and respect for women's autonomy and bodily integrity. The leaders of
the feminist organization womantra were among those identified as
coordinating the protest action and media engagement. Womantra is one of
the most vibrant, feminist Pan-Caribbean online spaces linked to
on-the-ground action in Trinidad and Tobago. Such spaces serve as a key
ground for mobilizing Caribbean feminist constituencies, as evidenced by
their street protest and online petition with more than 10,500
signatures.

A Jamaican government minister dismissed his country's Twitter users as
an "articulate minority" that does not express the views of "ordinary
Jamaicans,"[^2] and the noted Caribbean feminist activist Hazel Brown,
in response to her perception of a lack of civic activism, is quoted as
lamenting, "People are writing blogs, but what are we doing?"[^3] While
the perception that Caribbean people are not using online technologies
for significant civic participation is one shared by scholars, I seek to
challenge such assessments.[^4] Studies of Caribbean culture and
literature are finally acknowledging the significance of our
online-media-saturated worlds, as evidenced by recent research on
Afro-Dominican lesbian feminist organizing, Caribbean rhetoric, online
cultures, and literatures.[^5] Building on this move in Caribbean
cultural studies, I center Caribbean cyberfeminisms as
knowledge-producing spaces of political thought and action that may at
times either bridge or reinforce a digital divide but that nonetheless
deserve documentation.[^6] Such documentation, of feminist blogging in
particular, is the focus of my attempt to offer a necessarily
preliminary and partial mapping of Caribbean cyberfeminisms. Through an
analysis of feminist blogs, I make a claim for the existence of
Caribbean cyberfeminism as, in Susanna Paasonen's words, "a critical
feminist position for interrogating and intervening in specific
technological forms and practices," visible in the ways bloggers
challenge normative and hegemonic configurations of both feminism and
digital technologies.[^7]

## Introducing Caribbean Feminist Cyberspace

Nicholas Laughlin (and the bloggers who left comments on his article)
traces key moments in Caribbean blogging, going back to at least 2000
with Taran Rampersad blogging from Trinidad and Tobago and the first
blog post from Mad Bull (a Jamaican living the Cayman Islands) in 2001.
[Guyana Gyal](http://sapodilla.blogspot.com) (Neena Maiya), described by
Laughlin as "the first Caribbean blogger to make a point of writing
consistently in a 'non-standard local dialect,'" began blogging in
2005.[^8] As one of the strongest female Caribbean voices who has been
blogging consistently, Guyana Gyal is clearly a pioneer of Caribbean
feminist blogging. Another pioneer, the Barbadian woman behind
*Titilayo*, a blog no longer active or available online, also espoused
feminist perspectives beginning in 2001. Thus Caribbean women as
bloggers and Caribbean feminist blogs specifically are integral to a
history of Caribbean blogging.

Online Caribbean feminisms are extremely diverse, heterogeneous, and
polyvocal. Networks may be simultaneously regional, national, and
global, or transnational and diasporic. Through practices of media
creation, curating, reblogging, retweeting, sharing, and commenting
across multiple social media platforms, Caribbean feminists knit
together online communities that are often linked to on-the-ground
organizing and action. The online feminist activism of Caribbean people
has caused major manufacturers to pull advertisements deemed offensive
by the community, forced dialogue about and ultimately police
investigations into the practices of journalists, and shut down websites
with sexist content. Below are key signposts of the significance,
emergence, and diversity of Caribbean cyberfeminisms:

- Queen Macoomeh initiated an [online
 petition](http://www.change.org/p/we-did-it-angostura-has-said-they-will-pull-the-ad-thank-you-all)
 against an Angostura advertisement with the tag line "Avoid the
 friendzone, offer her a real drink." Angostura subsequently removed
 the advertisement.[^9] The public protest against the advertisement,
 especially via the online petition, was reported by international
 media outlets such as Buzzfeed.[^10]

- Malaika Brooks-Smith-Lowe of [Groundation
 Grenada](http://groundationgrenada.com) and colleagues at the Goat
 Dairy Project have used crowdfunding to raise US\$63,160 to support a
 community agriculture project.[^11]

- [WOMANTRA](http://womantratt.wix.com/home) won a 2013 grant from the
 FRIDA Young Feminist Fund to organize a summer camp for girls
 transitioning to secondary school in Trinidad and Tobago. This
 demonstrates that communities that have their genesis online may
 incubate others forms of political organizing and intervention.[^12]

- Patrice Daniel, a twenty-nine-year-old feminist from Barbados and
 frequent contributor to International Planned Parenthood Federation's
 blog, generated what I consider to be a key moment in Caribbean
 feminist blogging history. Her "[An Open Letter to Caribbean Men, from
 Caribbean
 Women](http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/03/12/an-open-letter-to-caribbean-men-from-caribbean-women)"
 went viral, with over 10,000 shares on Facebook, demonstrating the
 extent to which her words resonated not only with Caribbean women but
 with women across the globe.[^13]

- Caribbean women, many of whom identify as feminists and are active in
 feminist and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) organizing
 have created online networks for "women who love women." LGBT
 organizations such as Guyana's [Society Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination](http://www.sasod.org.gy), Trinidad and Tobago's
 [Coalition Advocating for Inclusion of Sexual
 Orientation](http://www.facebook.com/caiso), and St. Lucia's [United
 and Strong](http://unitedandstrongstlucia.wordpress.com) maintain a
 significant online presence.[^14]

- [*Air Me Now*](http://www.facebook.com/AirMeNow) is a [YouTube
 show](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLNiArTOn_azPDdIR4FvkyepgRQrb9K8Y)
 hosted by women from Belize, the Bahamas, and Jamaica that highlights
 "Caribbean women's voices, Caribbean women's issues, Caribbean <span
 style="font-variant:small-caps;">oomanism</span>."[^15]

- Gender consciousness has also meant broader public engagement with
 questions of gender and sexuality, like that offered by the YouTube
 video created by a group of young Jamaican men in response to the rape
 of five women and girls. The video, titled [*Jamaican Anti-Rape
 Campaign (Please Share)*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS8uJ9dol5s),
 has received almost 40,000 views.[^16]

- The social media efforts of Ashlee Hinds, a twenty-three-year-old
 Barbadian student, to create positive images of fat black women
 resulted in a [transnational fashion
 blog](http://www.bigbeautifulblackgirls.com) and [Facebook
 page](http://www.facebook.com/BigBeautifulBlackGirls) titled [*Big
 Beautiful Black Girls*](http://bigbeautifulblackgirls.tumblr.com),
 with 217,434 followers.[^17]

These are but a few examples of the significance of Caribbean
cyberfeminist practices.

## Methods

In 2014 I hosted a Caribbean blog carnival titled [*e-Mas: To the
Caribbean, with
Love*](file:///C:\Users\Kelly\Documents\sx%20archipelagos%20May%202016\returned\redforgender.wordpress.com\e-mas-caribbean-blog-carnival).
Using the hashtag \#dearCaribbean, contributors from Venezuela, Curacao,
and St. Kitts and Nevis, as well as from the wider Caribbean and its
diaspora, submitted entries that were hosted on their own blogs as well
as on [*Feminist Conversations on Caribbean
Life*](https://redforgender.wordpress.com/).[^18] *Global Voices*
reviewed the series, as did Trinidadian writer Shivanee Ramlochan, whose
review was published in the *Trinidad* *Guardian* newspaper. US-based
feminist media site Feministing.com also featured the series.[^19]
*E-Mas* highlighted Amina Doherty's photography; Jermaine Ostiana's poem
"Trujillonomics"; Carla Moore's video *On Loving Yaad, Leaving Yaad, and
Why Some ah We Waan Run Come Back*; Stephanie Leitch's reflections on
her queer Baby-Doll mas'; and Gabrielle Hosein's essay "A Risky
Location: What It Means to Be an Indian Feminist in Our Region."
Ramlochan, herself a prolific digital griot, said of the collection:
"These are some of the best and brightest in Caribbean letters, writing
letters back home. They may often put forth theories that blast old,
time honoured paradigms to shred, indeed, this is one of their most
vital advantages. Digital space makes such collaborations not just
possible but easily navigable. This blog carnival is proof that room can
be constructed, in safe space, for every voice to interrogate its way
toward truth."[^20] Ramlochan's analysis suggests that these "digital
griots" must be taken on their own terms.[^21] The experience of hosting
the "blog carnival" underscored for me the importance of documenting and
analyzing online Caribbean feminisms.

This partial and tentative attempt to map the diverse networks, spaces,
and actors that constitute Caribbean online feminisms draws on my own
experiences of maintaining a personal blog since 2006 and managing
*Feminist Conversations on Caribbean Life* since 2010. It is therefore
limited by my own networks. It is also linguistically limited, since it
draws largely on media and actors published in English and English-based
Creoles and dialects, though that does not preclude the multilingual
abilities of some of the bloggers nor suggest that English is the
official language of the countries from which these bloggers hail. There
is reference to Cuban bloggers, but a more robust discussion on Cuban
cyberfeminisms is outside of the scope of this essay and can be found
elsewhere.[^22] Despite these obvious limitations, this mapping is still
useful for understanding Caribbean feminisms in the twenty-first century
and for understanding cyberfeminisms as a global and globalized
phenomenon.

I selected thirty-six key Caribbean feminist blogs for inclusion in the
analysis. The majority of these blogs either expressly identify as
feminist or reveal a feminist, gender-conscious politics in the nature
of their content. The list is also cross-referenced with the
twenty-eight bloggers who chose to register their blogs with the
CatchAFyah Caribbean Feminist Network, though not all of those blogs
were included in the analysis. The ones included represent almost
exclusively blogs that belong to Caribbean women and men. Caribbean
bloggers, however, also publish on blogs belonging to regional or
international organizations. The blogs highlighted in the analysis are
largely owned and maintained by the bloggers themselves.

As part of this documentation of Caribbean bloggers, I sought to
establish the national identities of these bloggers. Despite the claim
that representing the nation is a key part of Caribbean people's online
activities and identities, determining the nationality of a specific
blog or blogger is not always straightforward.[^23] While "representing
the nation" is important to the online personality and content of some
bloggers (e.g., Jamaica's [Carla
Moore](http://mooretalkja.wordpress.com)) and for others their
nationality is signaled in their blog title (e.g., [*Negra Cubana tenia
que ser*](http://negracubanateniaqueser.wordpress.com/)), some blogs are
best understood as Pan-Caribbean in scope (e.g., [*Roots and
Rights*](http://rootsandrights.wordpress.com) or [*Antillean Media
Group*](http://www.antillean.org)), as diasporic (e.g.,
[*BattyMamzelle*](http://battymamzelle.blogspot.com)), or as
multicountry projects (e.g., [*Add Fyah and
Stir*](http://addfyahandstir.wordpress.com/)).

In seeking to discover the issues most important to Caribbean
cyberfeminists, I undertook a content analysis of the blogs. I decided
to focus exclusively on the text-based blogs that were still active and
had updated at least in July 2015, excluding the blog to which I
regularly contribute and those not written in English. This gave a total
of nineteen blogs, of which fifteen are owned by women and three by men,
and one has multiple contributors. For convenience, I selected the five
most recent posts on each blog published in 2015 and included them in
the thematic analysis. This yielded some ninety-five blog posts that
were read closely for recurring topics.

Taking seriously Ramlochan's assertion that the Caribbean's digital
subjects must be understood on their own terms, I sought to categorize
the thirty-six blogs in the sample. The categories I propose as useful
for analyzing Caribbean feminist bloggers are, as much as possible,
drawn from the bloggers' own descriptions of their online practices.

## Categorizing Caribbean Cyberfeminisms

*Personal-is-political* is used to refer to personal blogs that draw on
personal experience to illustrate or analyze relations of power in wider
society. For example, in outlining the reason she decided to start
blogging, [Gabrielle Hosein](http://grrlscene.wordpress.com) argues that
the "'small p' politics that reflects just living a woman's life" while
rendered trivial in sexist imagination is, in fact, a source of women's
theorizing:

> i'm writing to live. to stand still instead of running from one end of
> the seesaw to the other, constantly trying to keep the whole in
> balance. the words do not express the 'big P' politics of public
> revolutions and realisations, but a consciousness of 'small p'
> politics that reflects just living a woman's life. . . .
>
> so much of women's lives, time, work, concerns are considered trivial,
> yet they are momentous . . . if only to our own self. in this spirit,
> i start this diary, charting the daily negotiation of managing work
> and family, for as long as i can and perhaps as long as i need.[^24]

Personal-is-political blogs therefore represent a continuation of
women's and feminist uses of diarying and journaling as a way of making
sense of the world and of insisting that women's experiences are
significant sources of knowledge.

I use the term *culture critic* to categorize blogs focused on cultural
and sociological analyses of relations of power such as gender, race,
class, and heterosexism and inequalities broadly. These blogs provide
social, political, and economic analyses of everyday life and (popular)
culture. Soyini Ayanna's description of her blog [*Creative
Commess*](http://soyluv.wordpress.com) makes explicit her role as
culture critic: "I frequently think about and critique popular West
Indian & Trinbagonian cultural trends, soca trends and what I see taking
place."[^25] Likewise, the tag line to Annie Paul's [*Active
Voice*](http://anniepaul.net)---"sharp, pointed, often witty commentary on
current events in Jamaica, the Caribbean, India and the world"---also
suggests her role as culture critic.[^26]

Personal-is-political and culture critic emerged as the most popular
classifications and are used to categorize half the blogs. This reflects
the extent to which Caribbean feminists are using blogging as a means of
analyzing and creating knowledge and dialogue around topical issues in
their countries and region. Most personal-is-political blogs are also
culture critic blogs; the distinction is that the personal-is-political
blogs use personal experience to illustrate, analyze, and comment on
broader sociocultural relations of gender, race, class, and sexuality.

*+Feminism* is perhaps the most difficult category to conceptualize,
though it is the second-most popular. It refers to blogs that do not
have an exclusive or primary focus on feminism, feminist perspectives,
gender, or sexuality but that do include either writing from a feminist
perspective or posts about women's, feminist, and LGBT issues. For
example, the [Antillean Media Group](http://www.antillean.org) is "a
caucus of journalists, researchers and policy analysts dedicated to the
stories that impact the Caribbean."[^27] Their coverage of Caribbean
stories includes issues of gender relations, covered from a profeminist
perspective. However, they also address a broad range of issues from
multiple perspectives.

*Media crossover* is used to refer to blogs that contain content
published both in mainstream and online media and private blogs. It
includes blogs by journalists and columnists as well as bloggers whose
online content is republished in national newspapers or bloggers who
have attracted significant mainstream media attention. This
categorization is important because it demonstrates new media's
imbrications with older forms of media. For example, the blogger
Gabrielle Hosein saw her personal-is-political blog attract mainstream
attention and subsequently be reprinted as a weekly column. Meanwhile,
in the face of uncertainty over whether his weekly column would be
renewed by the Trinidad *Guardian*, [Colin
Robinson](http://onenationmanybodies.wordpress.com) continued to make
articles available online via his blog. Thus the crossing implied by the
category of media crossover suggests multidirectional flows. It also
suggests the increasing salience of gender consciousness and feminist
thought in Caribbean public space. When the media crossover blogs are
added to this list of +feminism blogs, it reflects an important and
growing infiltration of feminist ideas into the mainstream,
demonstrating the extent to which feminist values, viewpoints,
perspectives, and issues form part of a gender-conscious public
conversation.

Likewise, while the feminist academics who blog do not necessarily
self-identify primarily as academics, I feel that the category of
*feminist-academic* is important, since it reveals the overlap between
digital and academic spaces. Seven of the blogs are categorized as
feminist-academic blogs. This demonstrates the extent to which feminists
in the academy have been using online media to produce and share
knowledge on a variety of issues. This number doubles when I include the
blogs of those of current or former students for whom courses in
women's/gender/feminist studies at universities in the Caribbean and
overseas have been crucial to their own identities and consciousness as
feminists. This demonstrates the importance of feminist academia to
Caribbean cyberfeminisms. It also suggests that understanding privilege,
class, and elitism is critical to unlocking Caribbean cyberfeminisms. To
the extent that Caribbean cyberfeminisms serve to reinforce rather than
challenge asymmetries of knowledge and power, their subversive potential
is undermined.

*Curator* describes blogs that gather and reproduce content published
elsewhere or curate original content from a variety of contributors
(e.g., WomenSpeak Project's [*Women
Speak*](http://womenspeak.tumblr.com), which solicits submissions).[^28]
The blog [*Repeating Islands*](http://repeatingislands.com) describes
itself as "a project intended to bring the broader Caribbean community
closer through the sharing of news and information that transcends the
linguistic divide in the region."[^29] This information sharing is done
through aggregating and curating news published on multiple Caribbean
news sites and serves the political mission of working across the
divides of imperial languages. Included in this work of curating are
also practices of reblogging, sharing, and citing the work of other
Caribbean cyberfeminists. For example, included among the links, images,
stories, and responses to reader questions that [Bad
Dominicana](http://bad-dominicana.tumblr.com) shares on her blog is a
quote from a blog post by
[BattyMamzelle](http://battymamzelle.blogspot.com) titled, "This Is What
I Mean When I Say 'White Feminism.'"[^30] Here, Caribbean feminists
build consciousness-raising communities online, share knowledge, and
think collectively through these practices of curating, linking, and
reblogging each other's work.

*Witty* refers to blogs from writers for whom wit, wordplay, humor, and
sarcasm function as key rhetorical devices and serve to make their media
both more accessible and appealing to a wide readership/viewership.
Annie Paul's tagline promises "witty commentary," and [Mar the
Mongoose](http://mongoosechronicles.blogspot.com)'s "tales of a fierce,
agile West Indian mongoose who moves quickly and sees much" also
suggests a quick wit.[^31] While only five of the thirty-six blogs
examined have been characterized as witty, it remains an important
category for understanding feminist rhetorical strategies.

Table: Caribbean Feminist Blogs and Bloggers


## Feminist Positionality

The ways Caribbean digital griots identify online reveal a cyberfeminist
practice that intervenes in dominant configurations of both feminism and
digital space as Northern/Western, white, and bourgeois and that render
Caribbean, feminist, and female voices as marginal. In their "about me"
pages, many of the bloggers expressly define themselves as feminist:

> This is me. Caribbean. Feminist, activist, poet, academic, educator,
> T-shirt graffiti artist.[^32]
>
> I am a black feminist\* and womanist and I prioritize black women &
> girls always. I often find myself revisiting areas pertaining to race,
> blackness, anti-blackness, culture and identity to name just a
> few.[^33]
>
> Three fabulous Caribbean feminist cousin-sisters.[^34]
>
> A feminist pop culture blog focused on film, television, music and
> critical commentary on media representation.[^35]

These feminist bloggers also articulate the critical and political
importance of women's voices and spaces, and by affirming "me nun tak
back nuh chat," they defiantly lay claim to their opinions, analyses,
and theorizing without apology:[^36]

> Lover and defender of my womanness, Africanness, my Caribbean
> heritage, my Barbados, my right to take up my space and protect our
> space.[^37]
>
> "Woman tongue, 'was-was' and tamarind tree, the three worse things."
> ---Jamaican proverb
>
> Translation: The woman's tongue, the wasp and the tamarind tree sting
> the most.
>
> This proverb suggests the potency of the female voice as an expression
> of incisive social critique.[^38]

Men also claim and participate in these cyberfeminist spaces, asserting,
"Yes, I am a Rasta, Socialist, Feminist Caribbean Man. Above all, I am
an Artist."[^39]

The explicit use of the term *feminist* signals its acceptance and
assumption of shared meaning. Feminism is a key part of the identity of
some of the bloggers whose work is examined here, such as Bad
Dominicana, who describes herself as a "raging mujercista," with
cyberfeminism also a key part of how some bloggers self-identify.[^40]
For example, [Negra Cubana](http://negracubanateniaqueser.wordpress.com)
describes herself as "ciberfeminista negra."[^41] These bloggers tend to
qualify the term *feminist* with *Caribbean* or *black*, suggesting an
awareness of the racially and geopolitically exclusionary way normative
feminism is often framed and of the antagonism between feminisms and
nationalism in postcolonial settings, or as a means of articulating the
specificity of their feminist thought and practice. I argue that the
insistence of geographical, national, racial/ethnic, and political
qualifiers is a key Caribbean practice of cyberfeminists that reveals an
understanding of themselves as speaking across a divide that contains
differently identified feminists and a sensitivity to communication as
key to emancipatory practices. Early 1990s representations of the
technological future visualized racialized embodiment as oppositional to
its liberatory promise, thus folding excitement about the promise of new
technologies into old racialized, gendered, and geopolitical
exclusions.[^42] The Net is therefore not a virtual place; it is very
much real for identities and economies. These bloggers treat Internet
media as extensions of the social spaces in which their bodies are
already engaged.

Commercial, consumptive, militaristic, and entertainment usages of the
Internet predominate, reinforcing the notion of an individual,
apolitical, consuming self as the modal way of being online.[^43] As
Marcia Forbes has noted, Jamaican youth view a lack of access to the
Internet and social media as a stigmatizing disadvantage.[^44]
Furthermore, even when Internet users are engaged in expressly
"political" projects, as are Caribbean feminists online, their
dependence on commercially driven platforms implicates them in these
hegemonic, militaristic, and commercial orientations of the Internet, as
well as in asymmetrical flows of information, media reach, and capital.
On the other hand, the Internet provides a space for a plurality of
voices, including the counterhegemonic. Via their explicit articulations
of their positionality, Caribbean feminists intervene in these
domination configurations of digital space.

The format of the online forum or the blog post with a comments section
allows for a multiplicity of voices. It therefore opens up spaces for
dialogue and negotiation. However, some Caribbean cyberfeminists warn
that you enter the media spaces they have created "at your own
motherfuckin risk," insisting, "i want you to feel alienated by me. i
want you to have to tiptoe around me like im a delicate creature who
will snap your head off if you so even think of messing w my
humanity."[^45]

By this they reveal heightened awareness to the ways being online folds
into hegemonic notions of what it means to be human and into the
gendered and racialized hierarchies of cyber/space. Their discursive,
rhetorical, and media-making practices reveal their "critical feminist
position for interrogating and intervening in specific technological
forms and practices."[^46] In this sense, it is important to view
national or ethnic markers not merely as a part of "representing the
nation online" but as a cyberfeminist practice that directly addresses
geopolitical and racial hierarchies inside and outside feminisms.[^47]

## Caribbean Feminist Concerns

Cyberfeminists bloggers cover a range of concerns in dialogue with
local, regional, national, and international current affairs. They
examine diverse issues, including drought, climate change, and
environmental degradation, as well as the manifestation of unequal
relations of gender in a range of areas. They explore embodiment,
transgender identities, skin color, and racisms and offer up
sophisticated analyses of heterosexuality and sexual politics that are
often muted in academic scholarship. Caribbean cyberfeminists train
their critical lenses to Caribbean and US popular culture, using these
as modes of engaging with feminisms. Caribbean cyberfeminists challenge
heteronormativity through their documenting of local, national, and
regional LGBT organizing and articulating a vision of citizenship and
nationhood that is inclusive. "I've always understood the project and
vision of nation to include me---that it was meant to include everyone,"
writes Colin Robinson. "I firmly believed there was progress in wrapping
ourselves in its symbols, which would make a difference where threatened
boycotts, shaming human rights reviews and bans of our culture didn't
quite appear to be working."[^48] Across multiple blogs, Caribbean
cyberfeminists express concern about governance, the masculinism of
state power, corruption, and holding state managers accountable. [Yaoni
Sanchez](http://generacionyen.wordpress.com)'s words are illustrative of
the views expressed by many: "With so many problems facing the country,
which affect millions of people, how could a day of 'the official organ
of State power' be squandered to sing the praises of a single man?
Situations like yesterday are proof that the pernicious cult of
personality remains intact among us, fostered by those who idolize a few
and those who swell with vanity at the flattery."[^49]

Bloggers also use social and electronic media to speak out against
sexual harassment and assault at the hands of men whose official power
would otherwise render these women silent. The excerpt below is
illustrative of the ways some Caribbean women have used personal blogs
to break the silence on sexual violence:

> "I went to him expecting some professionalism, you know, and all I get
> was him trying to bus' a hustle in me. Telling me about how he could
> do things to my body and how he want fuck me. I mean what shit is
> that? Can you imagine how I felt? How was I suppose to receive a
> service from a man like duh eh? And imagine this nonsense now, he get
> big government wuk."
>
> I related my own encounter with the same gentleman to her. It had
> happened more than 7 years ago at the Georgetown Magistrates' Court.
> Since then, I've heard many similar stories from women about him. The
> standard response to this particular official is "O, he? Everybody
> know how he stay."[^50]

Here, Guyanese blogger [Sara Bharrat](http://sarabharrat.wordpress.com)
relates a conversation she had with a woman taxi driver about a state
manager infamous for his sexual exploitation of women. Their narrative
exchange, which took place in the taxi, is an act of feminist solidarity
that is then extended to digital space.

Bloggers also analyze and expose racial/ethnic tensions in their
communities and countries, exposing antiblack and anti-Indian racism and
meditating on racialized identities in the region:

> When some Trinidadians make fun of the blackness of Tobagonians, it's
> not unlike the maligning of Haitians, overtly or subconsciously, as
> "*that* kind of Black"---too black.[^51]
>
> *"I do not know if I am East Indian, Trinidadian or West Indian." Sam
> Selvon, Opening Address to East Indians in the Caribbean Conference,
> University of the West Indies, Trinidad, 1979*
>
> While in the beginning I have not been overly concerned with being
> West Indian, there have been many days when I was not sure whether I
> was an East Indian or a Guyanese. In fact, I was afraid to be either
> of these things because I did not know how to make them live in
> harmony inside of me.
>
> There was a time when I could not fully nor comfortably embrace my
> East Indian heritage because I felt guilty; I felt as if I were
> somehow betraying my Guyaneseness. But then, how could I be Guyanese
> without my Indianness? It took me a while to realize why it was so
> hard to be Guyanese; I simply did not understand what it meant to be
> one of us.[^52]

Taken together, these diverse areas of concern reveal Caribbean
cyberfeminist participation in local, regional, national, and global
communities and demonstrate the subversive possibilities of digital
public spheres.

## Strategic Space, Strategic Action

While I have focused largely on individual bloggers, it is important to
recognize that blog posts are often cocreated, open-ended, community
projects. They may be reblogged on multiple blogs and shared via
Facebook, e-mail, and other media. Comments on the blog post itself, on
Facebook, and in lunch rooms co-construct knowledge, open up dialogue,
act as a form of consciousness raising, and may also challenge received
knowledge on inequalities, gender, and sexuality and serve to build
community. The process of commenting can shift the dialogue, help flesh
out the analysis initiated by the author, or make space for multiple and
dissenting voices.

Caribbean feminists have also published their work on the blogs of
others and on more outernational platforms. Jamaican-born, New
York-based lesbian poet, author, and performer Staceyann Chin is
published regularly in multiple US-based online media platforms and is a
very successful producer and user of social media, with 17,000 follows
on Twitter and 27,000+ on Facebook. Guyanese activist Sherlina Nageer of
Red Thread, Society Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination, and
Occupy Guyana writes frequently on her own Facebook page and has shared
those writings with a wider audience by publishing on the *Huffington
Post*, on *Black Looks* (a website owned by Nigerian journalist Sokari
Ekine, who is currently living in Haiti), and on CODE RED's blog
*Feminist Conversations on Caribbean Life*. Nageer used these multiple
platforms to denounce police killings in Linden*,* to share with a wider
audience her submission to the Committee on the Elimination of
Discrimination Against Women on the rights of lesbian, bisexual, and
transgender women in Guyana, and to report on the efforts of Guyanese
activists from women's, LGBT, and disability rights organizations to
mobilize against transphobic, homophobic, sexist, and ableist violence
in Guyana. Sherlina later started her own blog, [Freedom by Any
Means](http://freedombyanymeans.wordpress.com), on which she republishes
articles from her *Stabroek News* column.[^53]

BattyMamzelle, a US-educated twenty-something from Trinidad and Tobago,
was a regular contributor to US-based commercial pop feminism site,
*Jezebel*, with some of her most popular pieces gaining more than one
million unique views. In 2013, she wrote a
[post](http://battymamzelle.blogspot.com/2013/10/Why-Im-Quitting-Jezebel.html#.UlqP_FCsim4)
outlining her decision to no longer contribute to the site:

> I'm 23. I'm black. I'm West Indian. I didn't have a lot of exposure to
> feminism growing up. I cringe when I recall the things that I said
> about other women when I was a freshman in college, and the attitudes
> that I had towards sexuality and womanhood. I went to a Catholic
> school in a country that is still largely misogynistic. It was pretty
> much a given that I'd grown up to be an anti-woman little shit.
>
> But then I found Jezebel. I found Jezebel and I started reading. I'm
> the kind of person who just likes to know things, so perusing the site
> pre-Kinja was like a revelation to me. All of a sudden I had this
> entire vocabulary to explain the little microagressions that I'd faced
> all my life, and a community of women who were engaged in parsing
> those issues. I could finally vocalize why I felt an inconsolable rage
> when I was tone policed. I knew how to defend myself against slut
> shaming. I could explain in detail why rape culture was so insidious
> and why restrictions on reproductive freedom were a devastating step
> backwards for women.
>
> Jezebel taught me how to be a woman.
>
> And then it taught me that it didn't care about the kind of woman that
> I am.[^54]

BattyMamzelle's experience of the racism of online feminist communities
highlights the continuities and articulations with historically
sedimented relations of power that remerge in the very spaces that claim
to be feminist, polyvocal, rhizomatic, and queer. Her experiences
validate my earlier analyses about the strategic use of ethnic, racial,
national, and regional markers in bloggers' "about me" pages as both
recognition of and counter to prevailing exclusions in cyberspace.
Cyberfeminist spaces are becoming increasingly important to the
consciousness raising of a new generation of women and men, even when
these spaces themselves may be exclusionary.

Aside from blogging, Caribbean cyberfeminist communities are created
through the use of groups, pages, and campaigns, many of which are
hosted on Facebook. As Facebook moves to monetize every aspect of the
Facebook experience, Caribbean feminists who made strategic use of the
site for consciousness raising and community building are faced with
challenges resulting from the predominance of the commercial nature of
cyberspace. Prior to Facebook's changes to its policy for pages, once
someone "liked" your page, any content you posted there showed up in
their personal feed. One of the earliest attempts at building online
Caribbean feminist community, [CODE RED for Gender
Justice](http://www.facebook.com/redforgender/timeline?ref=page_internal)'s
Facebook page, which was inaugurated in 2010, capitalized on this
capacity to build readers, contributors, and commenters. Now Facebook
requires that you pay to promote each individual post to your page, or
else it only reaches a tiny percentage of your network. This no doubt
severely reduces the reach of Facebook-based campaigns, such as [Walking
into
Walls](http://www.facebook.com/WalkingIntoWalls/info/?tab=page_info),
whose page aggregates daily news stories of violence against women,
intimate partner violence, rape and sexual violence, and child abuse
from a wide range of Caribbean countries: "Walking into Walls is a
social media campaign that found its roots in a 2012 regional meeting
organized by the Caribbean Institute for Women in Leadership (CIWiL).
This campaign was developed by four passionate, committed Caribbean
women who are tired of the walls that are routinely hit in the struggle
to end violence against women."[^55] Its Facebook page is a digital
media resource of tremendous potential and importance that is intended
to contribute to awareness raising and to keep reports of violence
against women in the forefront of Caribbean people's minds. Such
Caribbean feminist media campaigns are important as independent media
sites that seek to compensate for the elisions in mainstream media,
though, of course, without the benefit of the same kind of reach. CODE
RED for Gender Justice on Facebook similarly covers a wide range of
topics related to gender inequality, violence, sexuality, disability,
and the environment.[^56] The dependence of Caribbean feminists on
privately owned corporate platforms that claim ownership of their
content while modifying their media delivery online with revenue
generation strategies undermines the subversive potential of Web 2.0. In
"Rethinking Cyberfeminism," Susanna Paasonen notes,

> Possibilities of lay users to interact with and shape the medium are
> more limited than they were fifteen or even ten years ago. While it
> was entirely possible to set up a catchy web site in the late 1990s
> with a basic mastery of HTML---and, perhaps, a few touches of the
> cutting-edge such as JavaScript---this is no longer the case. Code has
> grown increasingly complex and necessitates rather specialized skills.
> Rather than building their sites (such as personal home pages and
> online journals) from a scratch, users make use of customizable
> templates and social media applications (from Blogger to YouTube,
> Facebook, PhotoBucket and Flickr) when publishing their images,
> videos, texts and music. Riot Grrrl 'zines, with their DIY feel, have
> largely disappeared.[^57]

Feminist and gender-conscious journalists located within mainstream
media are nonetheless part of Caribbean cyberfeminism. Caribbean
feminist scholar Alissa Trotz's [*In the
Diaspora*](http://www.stabroeknews.com/category/features/in-the-diaspora)
column in *Stabroek News* brings a mainstream reach to feminist and
social justice advocates and writers. Online magazine
[*Outlish*](http://www.outlish.com), though not a feminist magazine per
se, has created a space for discussion of issues of gender, feminism,
and masculinity, with articles such as "Why Is There So Much Pressure on
Indian Men to Get Married?," "This Is Why I'm Feminist," and "Don't
Laugh but T&T Needs a Men's Movement." Feminists from the Caribbean have
also created their own online lifestyle magazines: for example, [*Black
Girl in the Ring*](http://blackgirlinthering.com), from Antigua and
Barbuda/Guyana, and [*CompleXD Woman*](http://www.complexdwoman.co.uk),
from Grenada/UK.[^58] Online activist practices include petitions,
mobilizing to shut down offensive websites, and promotion of offline
events such as popular actions, protests, and stands. Many longstanding
women's and feminist organizations in the region also maintain an online
presence.

Scholars, however, have drawn attention to the strategic space that
global South peoples make of the Net, arguing that rather than see
marginalized peoples as on the losing end of the digital divide, focus
should be on the creative and strategic uses they make of these
technologies.[^59] Stephanie Leitch of WOMANTRA shares that she
regularly uses the WOMANTRA community to mobilize women and men in order
to shutdown offensive websites and Facebook pages. She recalls a popular
online magazine that published an article titled "No Matter How Hot She
Is" that warned single men not to have sex with women more than twice
lest they become "disillusioned and depressed." Leitch left a comment
below the article, "basically telling the guy he was a sexist pig" and
encouraged others to do the same. The sheer volume of complaints the
magazine received caused the editorial staff to pull the article and
shutdown the website for a day. One of the managers then contacted
Leitch and ironically told her that she should be writing something
rather than "just talking." Leitch later wrote an article about sexism
and media responsibility that was published on the site. However, she
recalls of the blogger who wrote the original post: "\[He was\] was very
abusive, said i must be ugly or a lesbian and called another guy \[who
also complained about the article\] a faggit."[^60] The examples cited
here reflect diverse cyberfeminist strategies aimed at subverting
asymmetrical relations of gender. They intervene into the normalizing of
misogynist discourses and images by challenging mainstream media
normalization of unequal relations of gender and sexualized images of
women and girls.

## Future Directions

Online feminist spaces are important consciousness-raising and
pedagogical sites for Caribbean feminists. These sites, however, are
ones of unequal access and privilege. The necessity and challenges of
working across and through difference, race/ethnicity, color, class, and
privilege that were identified two decades ago by Caribbean feminists
organized in Sistren (Jamaica), Red Thread (Guyana), and the Caribbean
Association for Feminist Research and Action persist as key issues for
Caribbean feminist organizing.[^61] Caribbean historians have also
called attention to the ways Indo- and Afro-creole nationalisms have
marginalized indigenous people in the region.[^62] Investigations into
the extent to which online feminisms reproduce and reframe these
long-standing inequities and oppressions remain a key Caribbean
cyberfeminist project.

Online Caribbean feminisms are multigenerational, multiethnic,
transnational, and Pan-Caribbean. Caribbean feminists have engaged in
cyberactivist practices and used the Internet to build community,
organize, and mobilize. Nonetheless, issues of media reach as well as
dependence on commercial platforms whose very structures may be inimical
to feminist principles limit the subversive potential of these
strategies. Strategies such as the use of video, humor, personal
stories, and writing in nation languages serve to make online feminism
more accessible. However, as participation in digital cultures brings
with it notions of progress, modernity, and a supposedly apolitical
globalization, it is important for Caribbean cyberfeminism as a critical
approach to attend to the ways digital cultures may be complicit in
reinscribing inequalities.
