abstract: "Caribbean cyberfeminisms are diverse, heterogeneous, and polyvocal. Networks may be simultaneously national, regional, global, transnational, and diasporic. Through practices of media creation, curating, (re)blogging, (re)tweeting, sharing, and commenting across multiple social media platforms, Caribbean feminist knit together an online community that is often linked to on-the-ground organizing and action. Online feminist practices are therefore rich archives for the study of Caribbean feminisms. To date, scholarly work on women's and feminist movements in the region has failed to document and analyze these practices and sites of activism. Similarly, Caribbean feminist critiques of technology and new media are not well developed. The essay attends to this gap by offering a partial and preliminary mapping Caribbean cyberfeminisms primarily through documentation and analysis of Caribbean feminist blogs."

The murder of Japanese pannist Asami Nagakiya at Trinidad and Tobago's
carnival generated international headlines. The mayor of Port of Spain,
Raymond Tim Kee, seemed to blame Nagakiya for her own death, couching
the violence against her as a result of "vulgarity and lewdness in
conduct," underscoring that "women have a responsibility to ensure they
are not abused."[^1] Trinidadian women (and men) assembled outside City
Hall to demand the mayor's resignation. They also shifted the public
conversation on gender-based violence away from what they deemed
"victim-blaming" and "slut-shaming" toward one of state accountability
and respect for women's autonomy and bodily integrity. The leaders of
the feminist organization womantra were among those identified as
coordinating the protest action and media engagement. Womantra is one of
the most vibrant, feminist Pan-Caribbean online spaces linked to
on-the-ground action in Trinidad and Tobago. Such spaces serve as a key
ground for mobilizing Caribbean feminist constituencies, as evidenced by
their street protest and online petition with more than 10,500
signatures.

## Feminist Positionality

The ways Caribbean digital griots identify online reveal a cyberfeminist
practice that intervenes in dominant configurations of both feminism and
digital space as Northern/Western, white, and bourgeois and that render
Caribbean, feminist, and female voices as marginal. In their "about me"
pages, many of the bloggers expressly define themselves as feminist:

> This is me. Caribbean. Feminist, activist, poet, academic, educator,
> T-shirt graffiti artist.[^32]
>
> I am a black feminist\* and womanist and I prioritize black women &
> girls always. I often find myself revisiting areas pertaining to race,
> blackness, anti-blackness, culture and identity to name just a
> few.[^33]
>
> Three fabulous Caribbean feminist cousin-sisters.[^34]
>
> A feminist pop culture blog focused on film, television, music and
> critical commentary on media representation.[^35]

These feminist bloggers also articulate the critical and political
importance of women's voices and spaces, and by affirming "me nun tak
back nuh chat," they defiantly lay claim to their opinions, analyses,
and theorizing without apology:[^36]

> Lover and defender of my womanness, Africanness, my Caribbean
> heritage, my Barbados, my right to take up my space and protect our
> space.[^37]
>
> "Woman tongue, 'was-was' and tamarind tree, the three worse things."
> ---Jamaican proverb
>
> Translation: The woman's tongue, the wasp and the tamarind tree sting
> the most.
>
> This proverb suggests the potency of the female voice as an expression
> of incisive social critique.[^38]

Men also claim and participate in these cyberfeminist spaces, asserting,
"Yes, I am a Rasta, Socialist, Feminist Caribbean Man. Above all, I am
an Artist."[^39]
