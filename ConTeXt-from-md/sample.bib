The emphasis on numerical applications was a wholly natural consequence of the dominant interests of the men and women who designed, built, and operated those early computing machines.},

Some of these problems are set out in the first chapter.

The final chapter indicates the importance of the author’s conclusions for political and social theory at the time.},

The aim of the experiment was to measure and compare the level of usability of textual and multimodal interfaces. The usability parameters which are efficiency, effectiveness, and userspsilasatisfaction were considered in the study. In order to carry out comparative investigation, two independent groups were involved to evaluate two different interfaces using an experimental e-learning platform. First group (control) consisted of 22 participants using a text only interface platform. This platform used Microsoft Word 2007 and its dasiaadding commentspsilafeature as the modal. The second platform was based on a multimodal interface used by the experimental group and consisted of three multimodal tools to improve efficiency of e-learning. The modalities used by this experimental group were text, speech and graphics. The results obtained from this investigation have shown that the multimodal e-learning interface group took less time to complete the experimental tasks and successfully performed a higher number of tasks, and was more satisfied than the textual interface group. Therefore the Multimodal interface provided a more usable interface for the users in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction.},

Some of the important factors for the popular use of the PDF application are due to its platform independency and rich digital offerings such as ability to include multimedia files, direct URL access and HTTP communication. However its wider acceptance among the user community has also attracted the attackers to develop and spread malware using PDF files. Most of the existing security tools are not equipped to deal with the attacks related to PDF. In this paper we present different techniques that can be used by an attacker to generate PDF attacks. Then we propose portable document scanner (PDSCAN) which can detect the attacks by analyzing the suspicious objects and the scripts that are embedded in the documents. PDSCAN makes use of dynamic and static analysis techniques to deal with the malware. Finally we present detail analysis of a malicious PDF file in Virtual Box environment.},

	abstract = {Theory without practice is empty, practice without theory is blind, to adapt a phrase from Immanuel Kant. The sentiment could not be truer of cultural heritage ethics. This intra-disciplinary book bridges the gap between theory and practice by bringing together a stellar cast of academics, activists, consultants, journalists, lawyers, and museum practitioners, each contributing their own expertise to the wider debate of what cultural heritage means in the twenty-first century. Cultural Heritage Ethics provides cutting-edge arguments built on case studies of cultural heritage and its management in a range of geographical and cultural contexts. Moreover, the volume feels the pulse of the debate on heritage ethics by discussing timely issues such as access, acquisition, archeological practice, curatorship, education, ethnology, historiography, integrity, legislation, memory, museum management, ownership, preservation, protection, public trust, restitution, human rights, stewardship, and tourism. This volume is neither a textbook nor a manifesto for any particular approach to heritage ethics, but a snapshot of different positions and approaches that will inspire both thought and action. Cultural Heritage Ethics provides invaluable reading for students and teachers of philosophy of archaeology, history and moral philosophy - and for anyone interested in the theory and practice of cultural preservation.},

Whether designing lithography equipment containing ferromagnetic brushes, or detecting defects in aeronautics, some basic knowledge of 21st century magnetism is needed. From the magnetic tape on the pocket credit card to the read head in a personal computer, people run into magnetism in many products. Furthermore, in a variety of disciplines tools of the trade exploit magnetic principles, and many interdisciplinary laboratory research areas cross paths with magnetic phenomena that may seem mysterious to the untrained mind. Therefore, this course offers a broad coverage of magnetism topics encountered more often in this millenium, revealing key concepts on which many practical applications rest. Some traditional subjects in magnetism are discussed in the first half of the book, followed by areas likely to spark the curiosity of those more interested in today’s technological achievements. Although sometimes some aspects may seem difficult to comprehend at first, bibliography directs the reader to appropriate further study. Throughout the chapters, the student is encouraged to discover the not-so-obvious associations between different magnetics topics, a task that will prove to be at the very least rewarding.},

But who is the protagonist of that history that is coming—or has come—to a close? What is man? How did he come on the scene? And how has he maintained his privileged place as the master of, or first among, the animals?In The Open, contemporary Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben considers the ways in which the "human" has been thought of as either a distinct and superior type of animal, or a kind of being that is essentially different from animal altogether. In an argument that ranges from ancient Greek, Christian, and Jewish texts to twentieth-century thinkers such as Heidegger, Benjamin, and Kojève, Agamben examines the ways in which the distinction between man and animal has been manufactured by the logical presuppositions of Western thought, and he investigates the profound implications that the man/animal distinction has had for disciplines as seemingly disparate as philosophy, law, anthropology, medicine, and politics.},

	abstract = {In this paper we analyze the nuclear fusion rates among equal nuclei for all five different nuclear burning regimes in dense matter (two thermonuclear regimes, two pycnonuclear ones, and the intermediate regime). The rate is determined by Coulomb barrier penetration in dense environments and by the astrophysical S factor at low energies. We evaluate previous studies of the Coulomb barrier problem and propose a simple phenomenological formula for the reaction rate that covers all cases. The parameters of this formula can be varied to take into account current theoretical uncertainties in the reaction rate. The results are illustrated for the example of the C12+C12 fusion reaction. This reaction is important for the understanding of nuclear burning in evolved stars, in exploding white dwarfs producing type Ia supernovas, and in accreting neutron stars. The S factor at stellar energies depends on a reliable fit and extrapolation of the experimental data. We calculate the energy dependence of the S factor by using a recently developed parameter-free model for the nuclear interaction, taking into account the effects of the Pauli nonlocality. For illustration, we analyze the efficiency of carbon burning in a wide range of densities and temperatures of stellar matter with the emphasis on carbon ignition at densities ρ≳109 g cm−3.},

This paper considers the legislative history of this rulemaking, and it reports the results of a systematic content analysis of its 2000 and 2003 proceedings.  Inspired by the literature on political agendas, policymaking institutions, venue shifting, and theories of delegation, we conclude that the legislative motivations for §1201 were laundered through international treaties, obscuring the anticircumvention clause's domestic origins. Further, we conclude that the exemption proceeding is constructed not to protect noninfringing users, but to limit courts' ability to exonerate them via the traditional defenses to copyright infringement.  We then conduct a content analysis of the first two proceedings, conducted in 2000 and 2003. Exemption proponents generally interpret the law's intent in terms of policy goals such as fair use, whereas opponents see jurisdictional, procedural, and definitional obstacles to the granting of exemptions. The Register of Copyrights' interpretation of the law closely resembles that of opponents and, on more than one key point, she refers proponents back to Congress. We conclude that the Register has constructed a venue that is hostile to the interests of noninfringing users; in light of congressional rhetoric to the contrary, this constructs a Catch-22 for many who earnestly wish to engage in otherwise legal activities.

In blending, structure from two or more input mental spaces is projected to a separate "blended" space, which inherits partial structure from the inputs and has emergent structure of its own. New examples are presented. We show that meaning is not compositional in the usual sense and that blending operates to produce understandings of composite forms. Formal expression in language is a way of prompting hearer and reader to assemble and develop conceptual constructions, including blends; there is no encoding of concepts into words or decoding of words into concepts. Blending is at work in many areas of cognition and action, including metaphor, counterfactuals, and conceptual change. We point out two fundamental aspects of this general process: cross-space mapping of counterparts and integration of events.},

When maintenance of pursuit was tested using predictable waveforms (sinusoidal or triangular target motion), the gain of horizontal pursuit was greater, in all subjects, than that of vertical pursuit; this was also the case for the horizontal and vertical components of diagonal and circular tracking. When initiation of pursuit was tested, four subjects tended to show larger eye accelerations for vertical as opposed to horizontal pursuit; this trend became a consistent finding during diagonal tracking. These findings support the view that different mechanisms govern the onset of smooth pursuit, and its subsequent maintenance when the target moves in a predictable waveform. Since the properties of these two aspects of pursuit differ for horizontal and vertical movements, our findings also point to separate control of horizontal and vertical pursuit.},

A pair of such stimuli, experienced as a unitary perceptual event, is referred to as a “micropattern” composed of two “stimulus elements.” Ss could readily distinguish between two such micropatterns in which the temporal order of the stimulus elements was reversed. The discrimination was based on the perceptual dominance of the second stimulus element of each micropattern. This perceptual dominance was studied as a function of stimulus-element onset and offset asynchrony, the duration and intensity of the stimulus elements, and the difference (in frequency or wavelength) between the stimulus elements of a micropattern. The results suggest the existence of an operation of all perceptual systems in the time domain that acts to conserve information concerning the temporal order of the two stimulus elements at the expense of discriminatory acuity of the f’{\textasciitilde}rst element.},

It also raises questions about the class of automata that can serve as a basis for understanding the mind. I develop an account of implementation, linked to an appropriate class of automata, such that the requirement that a system implement a given automaton places a very strong constraint on the system.

	abstract = {A novel method of electronic storage is proposed, in which an electron beam would be used to drive active and passive semiconductor devices to perform the functions of a digital memory, including those of nondestructive read-out and reset. Principally to ascertain what speeds and output signals might be currently obtained if the storage method were implemented, an experimental study was made of the response to a bombarding electron beam of commercial “four-layer” and surface-barrier diodes which could function in the proposed store respectively as storage diodes and read-out diodes. Data presented on the Shockley Laboratories’ silicon 4N20D “four-layer” diode give the reduction of firing voltage caused by the bombardment as a function of beam current and bombardment duration. It is found that a beam current as weak as 0.2 µamp can fire a diode in 1/5 µsec. Three types of germanium surface-barrier diodes were studied for maximum speed of response to the bombarding beam current pulse and for charge multiplication. The “fastest” unit tested was a Philco 2N502 transistor modified for beam access to the base region by removal of the emitter dot. This unit could be bombarded to produce a 50 nsec pulse of 0.4 v peak across a 1000-ohm load. In the light of these data and of circuit and semiconductor device theory, a preliminary discussion is presented of the feasibility of a store providing a read-in rate of 5 megapulses/sec, a read-out rate of 15 megapulses/sec and a read-out signal ratio of stored ones to stored zeroes of 50 to 1.},

	shorttitle = {Behind the {Zines}},
	abstract = {Social networks are dominating today s headlines, but they are not the only platforms that are radically changing the way we communicate. Creatives such as designers, photographers, artists, researchers, and poets are disseminating information about themselves and their favorite subjects not via predefined media such as Twitter or blogs, but through printed or other self-published projects so-called zines. Those who publish zines are mostly interested in sole authorship, namely that all components including text, images, layout, typography, production, and distribution are firmly in the hands of one person or a small group. At their best, the results convey a compelling and consistent atmosphere and push against the established creative grain in just the right way. They provoke with surprising and non-linear food for thought. In short, zines are advancing the evolution of today s media. With a cutting-edge selection of international examples, Behind the Zines introduces the broad range of zines that exists today. These include zines that function as a new kind of project-oriented portfolio to showcase a self-profile or document an exhibit. While some act as (pseudo) scientific treatises to call the reader s attention to a specific topic, others serve as playrooms for creatives to run riot and express themselves and communicate with each other in a space that is free from editorial restrictions. The book examines the key factors that distinguish various zines. It introduces projects in which the printing process significantly influences aesthetics or in which limited distribution to a small, clearly defined target audience becomes part of the overall concept. Behind the Zines not only documents outstanding work, but also shows how the self-image of those who make zines impacts the scene as a whole. Through interviews with people involved in zine production and distribution, the book sheds light on various strategies for this evolving media form.},

It identifies two senses of reflexivity, one associated with ethnomethodological accounts of members’practical reasoning, the other with a more philosophical sense of conscious self-referencing, and analyses their relationship. The paper argues that the development of this form of analysis leads to a form of propositional undecidability which makes it typically ‘postmodern’. The development is linked to ideas of recursion, as these are expounded in computer science and mathematics, and to Derrida's interpretation of ‘textual fold’— this also being used to ground the association of reflexivity with postmodernism. The analysis ‘returns to the social’by considering aspects of Niklas Luhmann's explication of social reflexivity. It concludes by examining the understanding that a postmodern sociology might have of a postmodern society in which the grounds for social order have become undecidable.},

The need to minimize typing by the user leads to the conversational dialogues consisting of a series of “prompts” and responses. Such dialogue sequences are now being programmed into a wide range of systems, but there are currently available only limited guidelines on appropriate programming techniques. This paper expresses the view that the programming of interactive dialogue is an important technology for software engineering in its own right. It develops systematically a set of “rules” for dialogue programming and discusses them in terms of user psychology. It is hoped that this definitive approach will lead to additions, extensions, and refinements, to these rules, eventually generating a recognized technology for dialogue engineering.},

While it is perhaps unfair to expect everyone to be a cultural materialist or literary sociologist, I point out a number of features of the organisation of the World Literature industry that trouble Apter’s arguments about the anti-capitalist implications of our recognition of the untranslatable. Ultimately ownership is not a matter of perception, and non-owned literature, like non-alienated literary labour, cannot exist under capitalism. These circumstances will not change in the absence of some fundamental reorientation of the class dynamics of writing, publishing, and reading. To deown literature, the whole material constitution of the industry would have to be abolished and replaced with something else.},

One of their aims is to reduce the perceived blur created by moving objects that are tracked by the human eye. However, an improvement is only achieved if the video stream is produced at the same high refresh rate (i. e. 120 Hz). Some devices, such as LCD TVs, solve this problem by converting low-refresh-rate content (i. e. 50 Hz PAL) into a higher temporal resolution (i. e. 200 Hz) based on two-dimensional optical flow. In our approach, we will show how rendered three-dimensional images produced by recent graphics hardware can be up-sampled more efficiently resulting in higher quality at the same time. Our algorithm relies on several perceptual findings and preserves the naturalness of the original sequence. A psychophysical study validates our approach and illustrates that temporally up-sampled video streams are preferred over the standard low-rate input by the majority of users. We show that our solution improves task performance on high-refresh-rate displays.},

	shorttitle = {Collected {Works} of {Velimir} {Khlebnikov}},
	abstract = {Dubbed by his fellow Futurists the "King of Time," Velimir Khlebnikov (1885-1922) spent his entire brief life searching for a new poetic language to express his convictions about the rhythm of history, the correspondence between human behavior and the "language of the stars." The result was a vast body of poetry and prose that has been called hermetic, incomprehensible, even deranged. Of all this tragic generation of Russian poets (including Blok, Esenin, and Mayakovsky), Khlebnikov has been perhaps the most praised and the more censured. This first volume of the Collected Works, an edition sponsored by the Dia Art Foundation, will do much to establish the counterimage of Khlebnikov as an honest, serious writer. The 117 letters published here for the first time in English reveal an ebullient, humane, impractical, but deliberate working artist. We read of the continuing involvement with his family throughout his vagabond life (pleas to his smartest sister, Vera, to break out of the mold, pleas to his scholarly father not to condemn and to send a warm overcoat); the naive pleasure he took in being applauded by other artists; his insistence that a young girl's simple verses be included in one of the typically outrageous Futurist publications of the time; his jealous fury at the appearance in Moscow of the Italian Futurist Marinetti; a first draft of his famous zoo poem ("O Garden of Animals!"); his seriocomic but ultimately shattering efforts to be released from army service; his inexhaustibly courageous confrontation with his own disease and excruciating poverty; and always his deadly earnest attempt to make sense of numbers, language, suffering, politics, and the exigencies of publication. The theoretical writings presented here are even more important than the letters to an understanding of Khlebnikov's creative output. In the scientific articles written before 1910, we discern foreshadowings of major patterns of later poetic work. In the pan-Slavic proclamations of 1908-1914, we find explicit connections between cultural roots and linguistic ramifications. In the semantic excursuses beginning in 1915, we can see Khlebnikov's experiments with consonants, nouns, and definitions spelled out in accessible, if arid, form. The essays of 1916-1922 take us into the future of Planet Earth, visions of universal order and accomplishment that no longer seem so farfetched but indeed resonate for modern readers.},

Muslim consensus has come to perceive this epithet for the Prophet of Islam as indicating conclusively that he was Muḥammad, 'the illiterate prophet.' Medieval and modern scholars, however, have drawn attention to further possible meanings of the Qur'anic term ummī. Based on an inquiry into the concepts of literacy and illiteracy in the Qur'an, this study hopes to provide some new insights into a complex issue that is of great significance for Muslims and for the study of Islam. Our findings suggest that a more comprehensive appreciation of the Qur'anic term al-nabī al-ummī can contribute essentially to the understanding of Muḥammad's prophethood and the history of Islam. ‮يصف القرآن النبيَّ محمداً بالنبي الٵمي. وقد تلقت الٲمة الٳسلامية ﮪذه التسمية لنبي الٳسلامٍ على ٲن الموصوف بها ﮪو قطعاً محمد، "النبي الٵمي". غير ٲن العلماء قديما وحديثاً نبهوا ٳلى معاني ٲخرى محتملة للفظة القرآنية "ٲميّ".‬ ‮وبالا عتماد على بحث مفهومي الٵمية وضدها في القرآن، تأمل هذه الدراسة ٲن تقدم فهماً جديدا ً لمسٲلة معقدة لها ٲهميتها البالغة لدى المسلمين، وفي دراسة الٳسلام. وما توصلنا ٳليه يشير ٳلى ٲن ٳدراكاً ٲشمل للتسمية القرآنية "النبي الٲمي" من شٲنه ٲن يسهم ٳسهاماً ٲساسياً في فهم نبوة محمد وتاريخ الٳسلام.‬},

	abstract = {This paper outlines astrophysical issues related to the long-term fate of the universe. The authors consider the evolution of planets, stars, stellar populations, galaxies, and the universe itself over time scales that greatly exceed the current age of the universe. Their discussion starts with new stellar evolution calculations which follow the future evolution of the low-mass (M-type) stars that dominate the stellar mass function. They derive scaling relations that describe how the range of stellar masses and lifetimes depends on forthcoming increases in metallicity. They then proceed to determine the ultimate mass distribution of stellar remnants, i.e., the neutron stars, white dwarfs, and brown dwarfs remaining at the end of stellar evolution; this aggregate of remnants defines the 'final stellar mass function.' At times exceeding ∼1–10 trillion years, the supply of interstellar gas will be exhausted, yet star formation will continue at a highly attenuated level via collisions between brown dwarfs. This process tails off as the galaxy gradually depletes its stars by ejecting the majority and driving a minority toward eventual accretion onto massive black holes. As the galaxy disperses, stellar remnants provide a mechanism for converting the halo dark matter into radiative energy. Posited weakly interacting massive particles are accreted by white dwarfs, where they subsequently annihilate with each other. Thermalization of the decay products keeps the old white dwarfs much warmer than they would otherwise be. After accounting for the destruction of the galaxy, the authors consider the fate of the expelled degenerate objects (planets, white dwarfs, and neutron stars) within the explicit assumption that proton decay is a viable process. The evolution and eventual sublimation of these objects is dictated by the decay of their constituent nucleons, and this evolutionary scenario is developed in some detail. After white dwarfs and neutron stars have disappeared, galactic black holes slowly lose their mass as they emit Hawking radiation. This review finishes with an evaluation of cosmological issues that arise in connection with the long-term evolution of the universe. Special attention is devoted to the relation between future density fluctuations and the prospects for continued large-scale expansion. The authors compute the evolution of the background radiation fields of the universe. After several trillion years, the current cosmic microwave background will have redshifted into insignificance; the dominant contribution to the radiation background will arise from other sources, including stars, dark-matter annihilation, proton decay, and black holes. Finally, the authors consider the dramatic possible effects of a nonzero vacuum energy density.},

Baudrillard, therefore, sees the modern semiotic order as based on the destruction of these symbolic relations, and its media accordingly as founded on a `non-communication'. In symbolic exchange, however, Baudrillard presents a complete and coherent theory of power, and his theory of communication illustrates the possibilities of transformation and reversal of established power and the system of non-communication which the reinstitution of symbolic relations can bring about.},

	abstract = {Portable Document Format (PDF) is used as a defacto standard for sharing documents. Even though pdf is a document description language, it has lot of features similar to programming language. With the add on support of JavaScript (Malicious script) and the facility to embed any file into a PDF document, creates a big potential for disastrous cyber attacks. From 2008 onwards, the malicious users are concentrating more on embedding malicious codes into pdf documents. Compared to PE, pdf files pose higher risk since the embedded content can be encrypted and/or encoded. Recently multistage delivery of malware is used for APTs and targeted attacks. Here pdf documents are used for accomplishing one or more stages, like mini-duke, where pdf file was used for first stage. It went undetected for almost two years. These files could be considered as a carrier of k-ary codes. In this paper, we bring out the importance of analyzing the data encoded in the stream tag along with other structural information. We are giving a proof of concept by embedding JavaScript into PDF document. This is not detected by any of the existing pdf parsers. Finally, we propose ensemble learning for detecting such pdf files.},

We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities.

Kant's definition of the subject—denied contact with the world as such and forced constantly to synthesize the immediacy of intuitions with the lawfulness of concepts—is a hopelessly riven “I-think.” Reading Kant was a traumatic event for contemporaries, especially for philosophers, who attempted to make the world whole again by formulating new versions of absolute unity. It was Wilhelm von Humboldt who theorized a way both to accept the gap in Kantian epistemology and, at least partially—through language understood as inner speech—to overcome the gap. Reacting to later appropriations of von Humboldt, Russian linguists and such literary theorists as Victor Shklovsky, Roman Jakobson, Sergej Karcevskij, and Mikhail Bakhtin explored the complexity of alienation in language and offered proposals for negotiating it in different versions of literariness.},

We present a roadmap that may serve as an example for other areas of clinical device research as well as an update on study results. Prior to conducting a multiyear clinical trial, years of animal research preceded BCI testing in an epilepsy monitoring unit, and then in a short-term (28 days) clinical investigation. Scientists and engineers developed the necessary robotic and surgical hardware, software environment, data analysis techniques, and training paradigms. Coordination among researchers, funding institutes, and regulatory bodies ensured that the study would provide valuable scientific information in a safe environment for the study participant. Finally, clinicians from neurosurgery, anesthesiology, physiatry, psychology, and occupational therapy all worked in a multidisciplinary team along with the other researchers to conduct a multiyear BCI clinical study. This teamwork and coordination can be used as a model for others attempting to translate basic science into real-world clinical situations.},

However, aside from a small number of survey-based studies of preference among disparate taxa, human species preferences have received little attention. I determined human aesthetic preferences among a relatively homogenous group, the penguins, from representation in all recently published, comprehensive, popular books of photographs of penguins (n = 4 books; 304 photographs). Representation of visually distinguishable types of penguins, measured by total photograph area, was highly skewed and rankings were highly concordant across books, suggesting large and commonly held differences in aesthetic appeal. Multiple regression analysis indicated that amount of warm color was the only significant determinant of representation, and warm color was highly correlated (r 2 = 0.96) with mean representation of the penguin types. Body size and neotenic form, traits found to influence human preferences among other animals, were not significant, suggesting that the bases of human species preferences differ by species type. The results of this study indicate that human aesthetic preferences discriminate finely among species and may be based on minor features. Conservationists must be vigilant to the potential for aesthetic responses to influence conservation efforts.},

Both methods have disadvantages: EEG has limited resolution and requires extensive training, while single-neuron recording entails significant clinical risks and has limited stability. We demonstrate here for the first time that electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity recorded from the surface of the brain can enable users to control a one-dimensional computer cursor rapidly and accurately. We first identified ECoG signals that were associated with different types of motor and speech imagery. Over brief training periods of 3–24 min, four patients then used these signals to master closed-loop control and to achieve success rates of 74–100\% in a one-dimensional binary task. In additional open-loop experiments, we found that ECoG signals at frequencies up to 180 Hz encoded substantial information about the direction of two-dimensional joystick movements. Our results suggest that an ECoG-based BCI could provide for people with severe motor disabilities a non-muscular communication and control option that is more powerful than EEG-based BCIs and is potentially more stable and less traumatic than BCIs that use electrodes penetrating the brain.},

It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method.

The vast majority of BCI systems rely on feature vectors derived from e.g., bandpower or univariate adaptive autoregressive (AAR) parameters. However, ample evidence suggests that additional information is obtained by quantifying the relationship between signals of single electrodes, which might provide innovative features for future BCI systems. This paper investigates one method to extract the degree of phase synchronization between two electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by calculating the so-called phase locking value (PLV). In our offline study, several PLV-based features were acquired and the optimal feature set was selected for each subject individually by a feature selection algorithm. The online sessions with three trained subjects revealed that all subjects were able to control three mental states (motor imagery of left hand, right hand, and foot, respectively) with single-trial accuracies between 60\% and 66.7\% (33\% would be expected by chance) throughout the whole session},

	abstract = {A system to control the use of an informational product is disclosed. The informational product is stored on a storage medium and executed by a first processor. The informational product is operatable in a plurality of modes. The system comprises three manufacture modules. The first manufacture module, executed by the first processor, generates a registration code for a user of the informational product, the registration code being a function of the identity of the first processor, the identity of the user and the identity of the informational product. The second manufacture module, executed by the first processor, accepts as input an authorization code, verifies the authorization code and, if the verification is successful, changes the operational mode of the informational product. The second manufacture module also stores a user record in the informational product. The third manufacture module examines the user record each time the informational product is activated. The third module determines the operational mode of the informational product as a function of the operational mode stored in the user record and the identity of the processor on which the third module is executed. The third module returns to the informational product the user record.},

Both these metaphors create an image of internet as a virtual world, one in which motion and direction become possible. These developments in the metaphorical presentation of the internet parallel Jean Baudrillard's discussion of an emerging "hyperreality": a world of simulation in which "the real" becomes less significant than its model. A Baudrillardian reading of internet presents the internet as a "hypertelic" mode of communication. As internet develops, "sites" of virtual reality become more compelling and thereby more "real," exposing the overall conceptual model of Internet as a comprehensive and comprehendible world and a substitute for the real world. But Baudrillard also provides room for a reversal of this reading in which internet becomes a challenge to these closed systems. Ultimately, the seductive qualities of the technology can also lead to the creation of a "space" for drift, experimentation, and play.},

	shorttitle = {Mimesis and alterity},
	abstract = {Mimesis: the idea of imitation. Alterity: the idea of difference, the opposition of Self and Other. In his most accomplished work to date, Michael Taussig explores these complex and often interwoven concepts. Arguing that mimesis is the nature that culture uses to create second nature, he maintains that mimesis - variously experienced in different societies - is not only a faculty but also a history. That history, Taussig writes, is deeply tied to "Euroamerican colonialism, the felt relation of the civilizing process to savagery, to aping, sensateness caught in the net of passionful images spun for several centuries by the colonial trade with wildness." For anthropologists, social scientists, cultural critics, artists and everyone else caught up in the enigma of the postmodern, framing the question "What is Reality" is crucial to gaining an understanding of what it is we know and who we are. Why is it important to understand that traditions are inventions and that social life is a construction when they grip us with all the force of the "natural"? And how is it that we understand reality as both real and really made up? In Mimesis and Alterity Taussig undertakes an eccentric history of the mimetic faculty. He moves easily from the nineteenth-century invention of mimetically capacious machines, such as the camera, backwards to the fable of colonial "first-contact" and alleged mimetic prowess of "primitives," and then forward to contemporary time, when the idea of alterity is increasingly unstable. Utilizing anthropological theory, Taussig blends Latin American ethnography and colonial history with the insights of Walter Benjamin, Adorno and Horkheimer. Vigorous and unorthodox, Taussig's understanding of mimesis in different cultures deepens our meanings of ethnography, racism and society.},

	abstract = {The ongoing transposition of the EU Information Society Directive's requirement that member States adopt of legal prohibitions of the circumvention of technological protections of works of authorship occasions this review of international obligations and their implementation in the US. This article addresses the scope of international obligations the WIPO Copyright Treaties impose on member States to protect against circumvention, as well as the US experience with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's prohibitions on circumvention of access and copy controls. It examines the text of the statute, codified at sec. 1201 of the 1976 Copyright Act, the five years of judicial decisions interpreting the statute, and the two administrative proceedings implementing one aspect of the statutory scheme. The analysis of the DMCA and its judicial and administrative interpretation will take up three issues:   1) What technological measures does sec. 1201 protect?  2) What conduct does sec. 1201 prohibit? 3) To what extent does sec. 1201 accommodate copyright exceptions?  The US experience to date indicates that legal protection for technological measures has helped foster new business models that make works available to the public at a variety of price points and enjoyment options, without engendering the "digital lockup" and other copyright owner abuses that many had feared. This is not to say that the US legislation and its judicial interpretation represent the most preferable means to making the internet a hospitable place for authors while continuing to enable lawful user conduct. But brooding forecasts and legitimate continuing concerns notwithstanding, the overall equilibrium so far appears to be a reasonable one.},

I then go on to argue that the demographics of infrastructure within the digital humanities, therefore in part its emphasis, is historically due to the socially inferior role assigned to those who in the early years found para-academic employment in service to the humanities. I do not specify an agenda, rather conclude that modelling, pursued within its humane context, offers a cornucopia of agenda if only the "mind-forged manacles" of servitude's mind-set can be broken.},

Far richer in information and more incisive than America at Home (Smolan and Erwitt), it also moves well beyond Rick Smolan's Day in the Life series. It is a distant cousin of Material World and Hungry Planet in content and style, but represents a blend of rigorous science and photography that none of these books can claim. Using archaeological approaches to human material culture, this volume offers unprecedented access to the middle-class American home through the kaleidoscopic lens of no-limits photography and many kinds of never-before acquired data about how people actually live their lives at home. Based on a rigorous, nine-year project at UCLA, this book has appeal not only to scientists but also to all people who share intense curiosity about what goes on at home in their neighborhoods. Many who read the book will see their own lives mirrored in these pages and can reflect on how other people cope with their mountains of possessions and other daily challenges. Readers abroad will be equally fascinated by the contrasts between their own kinds of materialism and the typical American experience. The book will interest a range of designers, builders, and architects as well as scholars and students who research various facets of U.S. and global consumerism, cultural history, and economic history.},

Once files are reduced to the status of stylized icons on computer screens, the reign of paper files appears to be over. With the epoch of files coming to an end, we are free to examine its fundamental influence on Western institutions. From a media-theoretical point of view, subject, state, and law reveal themselves to be effects of specific record-keeping and filing practices. Files are not simply  administrative tools; they mediate and process legal systems. The genealogy of the law described in Vismann's Files ranges from the work of the Roman magistrates to the concern over one's own file, as expressed in the context of the files kept by the East German State Security. The book concludes with a look at the computer architecture in which all the stacks, files, and registers that had already created order in medieval and early modern administrations make their reappearance.},

This paper briefly highlights several significant early milestones and then draws particular attention to typewriter developments within the IBM Corporation. After entering the typewriter business in 1933, IBM expanded the applicability of electric typebar machines and introduced proportional spacing to electric typewriters. The IBM SELECTRIC® Typewriter single-print-element concept represented a major departure from traditional typewriter design. Since the introduction of the SELECTRIC Typewriter, it has evolved in several directions that resulted in the following: a typewriter to produce high-quality printing for cold-type composing applications; an input/output writer for use in terminals, computer consoles, and word processing machines; a typewriter that can correct errors by mechanically removing them from the page or covering them up; and electronic typewriters, using microcircuitry, that provide more memory and computing power than some early computers.},

It plays a central role in Islam and ever since it appeared fourteen hundred years ago has been the subject of intense debate. Some of this has been carried out by Muslims and some by those hostile or indifferent to Islam, producing a very wide range of views.  Authored by forty-three international experts, the objective of The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia is to present this diversity of thought, approach and school without priority, in order to give a strong appreciation of the range of response that the text has provoked throughout its history and providing students and researchers with a powerful one-volume resource covering all aspects of the text and its reception. Islam and the Qur'an are much in the news today and there is a public debate going on in which things are said about the Qur'an without much knowledge or understanding of the book. Every effort has been made to help the reader use the Encyclopedia as an investigative tool in Quranic studies. The volume assumes no previous knowledge of the Qur'an, Islam or Arabic. Technical terms are explained in the text itself and the style of each entry is designed to be as self-contained as possible. Entries are cross-referenced and many include a brief bibliography. At the end of the work there is a substantial annotated bibliography providing a detailed guide to the most significant books, journals and articles in Qur'anic Studies. There is a full index.  The readership will include those seeking basic information on the Qur'an, however the substantial number of longer entries means that it will also be used by specialists.},

The inherent difficulty with capacitor storage was the limited holding time since a nonlinear resistor with small enough leakage currents to allow useful memory holding time was then not readily available. The old capacitor memory was charged through a diode with slow recovery time and with leakage current of 10−10 amp at best and required a large capacitor for any appreciable holding time.

The forms of communication media available to coordinate the problem solving activities of the individual processors are examined. Some general remarks are made on how problem solving is distributed and coordinated in some human organizations, and the potential usefulness of the " society of specialists" notion in explicating cognitive activity is pointed out.

	abstract = {Measurements of threshold visibility were made as a function of duration of stimulus exposure for small moving dot targets, drifting sinusoidal gratings and moving patches of sinusoidal gratings, to investigate how the human visual nervous system summates over time signals arising from stimuli in motion. At image speeds of less that 16 deg/s, temporal summation is as strong and as extended for moving as for stationary dots (total summation over to about 100 ms). This summation is about twice that which would be expected from separate consideration of the regions of spatial and temporal integration. Measurements with sinusoidal gratings reveal that the nature of the summation depends critically on the spatial frequency of the stimulus: gratings of low spatial frequency summate well when in motion (and only when in motion), whereas those of high spatial frequency summate well only when stationary or in very slow motion. An analogue simulation with electronic filters showed that these psychophysical results are directly predictable from the known transfer characteristics of the human visual system (with the additional assumption of probability summation at threshold). Finally, with small patches of sinusoidal grating, it was established that translation per se across the retina has little effect on temporal summation. This suggests that the results obtained with sinusoidal gratings of large extent are also relevant to small moving stimuli, allowing the summation results obtained with dot stimuli to be discussed in terms of the temporal transfer properties of spatially selective visual detectors. On the basis of these results it is proposed that the extended temporal summation observed for dots in motion results from summation of energy of low spatial frequency present in these stimuli.},

A few network measures have been proposed for weighted networks, including three common measures of node centrality: degree, closeness, and betweenness. However, these generalizations have solely focused on tie weights, and not on the number of ties, which was the central component of the original measures.

The security technique provides a method for authorizing access by a process located in an invocation node to an object, or a network resource, located in an execution node. The method includes the steps of granting permission to the invocation node to access the object by transmitting a capability and a signature from the execution node to the invocation node. The capability includes a unique indentifier of the object and access rights to the object. The signature is formed at the execution node by encryption of the capability with an encryption key that is unique to the invocation node and is stored only in the execution node. A request for access to the object is transmitted with the capability and the signature from the invocation node to the execution node. At the execution node, the request is authenticated by encryption of the capability with the encryption key that is associated with the invocation node to form a test signature. Access to the object is authorized only when the test signature matches the signature received from the invocation node.},

It is an examination of the ways adopted at various levels to counter the crescendo of phishing attacks and new techniques being evolved for the same. All across the globe today, Adobe Portable Document Format stands as the most popularly used and trusted document description format. The overriding objective is to exhaustively explore and evaluate the risk attached to PDF in terms of masquerading as a trustworthy entity which could successfully result in an attack. A few risk reduction security measures at the users' level are also suggested. This work intends to increase the awareness and understanding of the internet user throughout the world. Furthermore, an effort has been put in to even discuss plausible countermeasures. This conceptual paper is definitely expected to contribute to future research on similar and related topics as spin off from this study.},

	isbn = {978-0-226-32140-0},
	shorttitle = {How {We} {Think}},
	abstract = {“How do we think?” N. Katherine Hayles poses this question at the beginning of this bracing exploration of the idea that we think through, with, and alongside media. As the age of print passes and new technologies appear every day, this proposition has become far more complicated, particularly for the traditionally print-based disciplines in the humanities and qualitative social sciences. With a rift growing between digital scholarship and its print-based counterpart, Hayles argues for contemporary technogenesis—the belief that humans and technics are coevolving—and advocates for what she calls comparative media studies, a new approach to locating digital work within print traditions and vice versa. Hayles examines the evolution of the field from the traditional humanities and how the digital humanities are changing academic scholarship, research, teaching, and publication. She goes on to depict the neurological consequences of working in digital media, where skimming and scanning, or “hyper reading,” and analysis through machine algorithms are forms of reading as valid as close reading once was. Hayles contends that we must recognize all three types of reading and understand the limitations and possibilities of each. In addition to illustrating what a comparative media perspective entails, Hayles explores the technogenesis spiral in its full complexity. She considers the effects of early databases such as telegraph code books and confronts our changing perceptions of time and space in the digital age, illustrating this through three innovative digital productions—Steve Tomasula’s electronic novel, TOC; Steven Hall’s The Raw Shark Texts; and Mark Z. Danielewski’s Only Revolutions.   Deepening our understanding of the extraordinary transformative powers digital technologies have placed in the hands of humanists, How We Think presents a cogent rationale for tackling the challenges facing the humanities today.},

In the 1980s, new theories on the cognitive processes involved with the use of metaphor challenged these assumptions, but with little empirical support. Drawing on the latest research in linguistics, semiotics, philosophy, and psychology, Cornelia Müller here unveils a new approach that refutes the rigid dead/alive dichotomy, offering in its place a more dynamic model: sleeping and waking.},

In this paper the following two fundamentally important factors in connection with this problem are given principal attention: 1. Signal shaping, i. e., giving signals the best wave shape before impressing them on the transmitting medium so as to be able to send signal elements at maximum speed without undue interference into other circuits. 2. Choice of codes so as to transmit the maximum amount of intelligence with a given number of signal elements. These factors are discussed with the idea of indicating the best methods, as well as to give an idea of what may be expected from these methods. In connection with the choice of codes, consideration is given to the effect of codes differing in the number of “currentt values” employed. By this is meant the number of different current values which are employed in a system in forming the different characters.},

This work was directly related to Turing's leading role in breaking the German Enigma ciphers during World War II, a scientific triumph that was critical to Allied victory in the Atlantic. Despite his wartime service, Turing was eventually arrested, stripped of his security clearance, and forced to undergo a humiliating treatment program-- all for trying to live honestly in a society that defined homosexuality as a crime. This New York Times bestselling biography of the founder of computer science and artificial intelligence is the definitive account of an extraordinary mind and life. --Excerpted from 2014 version, published by Princeton University Press.},

The model hyperparameters are inferred using a Gibbs EM algorithm. On two data sets, each of 150 documents, the new model exhibits better predictive accuracy than either a hierarchical Dirichlet bigram language model or a unigram topic model. Additionally, the inferred topics are less dominated by function words than are topics discovered using unigram statistics, potentially making them more meaningful.},

	abstract = {This monograph is a long-term analysis of citizens' collective action to influence public policy toward communication and information.  We define and defend a vision of communication and information policy (CIP) as a comprehensive and integrated policy domain. We also define and describe the three primary modes of advocacy around CIP issues. We draw on theories of institutions and institutional change to provide a framework for the report.   Organizational ecology methods are used to analyze how the population of public interest advocacy groups has changed over 40 years. Organizational ecology is a social science method that looks at organizations in a particular field as a population and analyzes how the size and composition of the population changes over time. Our research gathered data on the formation and disbandment of public interest advocacy organizations devoted to CIP issues in the United States from 1961 to 2002. That data permitted us to estimate changes in the size of the population, its ideological composition, which media or information policy issues the groups focused on, and which modes of advocacy were employed.   We gathered comprehensive data about congressional testimony on communication and information policy issues in the U.S. Congress from 1969 to 2002. That data permits us to objectively measure the amount of Congressional activity on CIP issues in a given year, permitting analysis of how it changed over time and how the numbers compared to other issue areas. It also tells us how often specific public interest organizations and the individuals who work for them have gained access to lawmakers.  We describe and assess the mass media activism of the mid-1960s and 1970s, the period of the most rapid rate of growth in the population. We show that most advocacy at this time focused on broadcasting and cable TV. We discuss four major institutional changes in CIP that occurred in this period, with or without the advocates' participation. We describe how the 1980s was characterized by major changes in both the political climate and the type of communication-information policy issues under consideration. We document the appearance of computer professionals and technologists organizing around computer-related policy issues in the organizational population for the first time.   We show how in the 1990s digital technology became the focal point of institutional change in CIP, leading to an explosion of Congressional activity, bringing in a new generation of advocacy groups and creating a major change in the composition of the advocacy organization population.},

	abstract = {The Audible Past explores the cultural origins of sound reproduction. It describes a distinctive sound culture that gave birth to the sound recording and the transmission devices so ubiquitous in modern life. With an ear for the unexpected, scholar and musician Jonathan Sterne uses the technological and cultural precursors of telephony, phonography, and radio as an entry point into a history of sound in its own right.  Sterne studies the constantly shifting boundary between phenomena organized as "sound" and "not sound."  In The Audible Past, this history crisscrosses the liminal regions between bodies and machines, originals and copies, nature and culture, and life and death. Blending cultural studies and the history of communication technology, Sterne follows modern sound technologies back through a historical labyrinth. Along the way, he encounters capitalists and inventors, musicians and philosophers, embalmers and grave robbers, doctors and patients, deaf children and their teachers, professionals and hobbyists, folklorists and tribal singers.  The Audible Past tracks the connections between the history of sound and the defining features of modernity: from developments in medicine, physics, and philosophy to the tumultuous shifts of industrial capitalism, colonialism, urbanization, modern technology, and the rise of a new middle class.A provocative history of sound, The Audible Past challenges theoretical commonplaces such as the philosophical privilege of the speaking subject, the visual bias in theories of modernity, and static descriptions of nature. It will interest those in cultural studies, media and communication studies, the new musicology, and the history of technology.},

Now Henry Petroski turns to the subject of books and bookshelves, and wonders whether it was inevitable that books would come to be arranged vertically as they are today on horizontal shelves. As we learn how the ancient scroll became the codex became the volume we are used to, we explore the ways in which the housing of books evolved. Petroski takes us into the pre-Gutenberg world, where books were so scarce they were chained to lecterns for security. He explains how the printing press not only changes the way books were made and shelved, but also increased their availability and transformed book readers into books owners and collectors. He shows us that for a time books were shelved with their spines in, and it was not until after the arrival of the modern bookcase that she spines faced out.In delightful digressions, Petroski lets Seneca have his say on "the evils of book collecting"; examines the famed collection of Samuel Pepys (only three thousand titles: old discarded to make room for new); and discusses bookselling, book buying, and book collecting through the centuries.Richly illustrated and wonderfully written, this is the ultimate book on the book: how it came to be and how we have come to keep it.},

	abstract = {What is the "real Russia"? What is the relationship between national dreams and kitsch, between political and artistic utopia and everyday existence? Commonplaces of daily living would be perfect clues for those seeking to understand a culture. But all who write big books on Russian life confess their failure to get properly inside Russia, to understand its "doublespeak."   Boym is a unique guide. A member of the last Soviet Generation, the Russian equivalent of our Generation X, she grew up in Leningrad and has lived in the West for the past thirteen years. Her book provides a view of Russia that is historically informed, replete with unexpected detail, and everywhere stamped with authority. Alternating analysis with personal accounts of Russian life, Boym conveys the foreignness of Russia and examines its peculiar conceptions of private life and common good, of Culture and Trash, of sincerity and banality. Armed with a Dictionary of Untranslatable Terms, we step around Uncle Fedia asleep in the hall, surrounded by a puddle of urine, and enter the Communal Apartment, the central exhibit of the book. It is the ruin of the communal utopia and a unique institution of Soviet daily life; a model Soviet home and a breeding ground for grassroots informants. Here, privacy is forbidden; here the inhabitants defiantly treasure their bits of "domestic trash," targets of ideological campaigns for the transformation (perestroika) of everyday life.   Against the Russian and Soviet myths of national destiny, the trivial, the ordinary, even the trashy, take on a utopian dimension. Boym studies Russian culture in a broad sense of the word; she ranges from nineteenth- and twentieth-century intellectual thought to art and popular culture. With her we go walking in Moscow and Leningrad, eavesdrop on domestic life, and discover jokes, films, and TV programs. Boym then reflects on the 1991 coup that marked the end of the Soviet Union and evoked fin de siècle apocalyptic visions. The book ends with a poignant reflection on the nature of communal utopia and nostalgia, on homesickness and the sickness of being home.},

	abstract = {This article examines the idiom ‘smoking gun’ which has been much used in the controversy about the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. It is necessary to take a historical approach to understanding how metaphors might enter the political lexicon and how their usage and meaning might change over time. The passage from metaphor to idiom is often characterized in terms of a movement from ‘living’ metaphor to ‘dead’ metaphor. To understand how such a passage occurs, the current investigation draws upon Glucksberg’s ‘property attribution’ model of metaphor and contrasts it with Lakoff’s notable theory of metaphors. The ‘smoking gun’ idiom is traced to the Watergate controversy and its pragmatic uses in the political rhetoric of accusation are examined. It is suggested that there is nothing automatic in the use of such a phrase, as the rhetoric of blame can be countered by attempts to return the idiom from literal to metaphorical meaning. The ideological effects of the idiom ‘smoking gun’ are discussed and so, more generally, is the passage from metaphor to idiom in political discourse.},

	abstract = {Umberto Eco has suggested that we imagine a methodological bifurcation in the intellectual culture of late medieval missionary Christianity, a bifurcation presenting two quite distinct responses to the biblical story of Babel and the post-Roman allegory of “Europe” it represents. This essay suggests that we reconsider some of the most important debates in u.s.-based literary and cultural studies during the last two decades and imagine them as genealogically sprung from this bifurcation in responses to linguistic diversity during the formation of the idea of Europe. Over the last twenty years or so, responding to world-historical transitions like those of 1989-91 and 2001, the discipline of comparative literature has reexamined some of its key concepts (world, comparison, translation) as well as what is probably the most distinctive aspect of its method, acquired professional multilingualism. It is only more recently that a nominally newer formation based more exclusively in departments of English studies has re-presented us with comparative literature’s methodological counterpart or other, and with its own intellectual and also ethical challenges. That formation is the digital humanities, understood as what the author calls, adapting a phrase from David Golumbia, a culture of computation—and grasped in its emergence after 2001, alongside a surge of u.s. national security legislation and institution-building.},

	abstract = {Truth, reason, and objectivity--can we survive without them? What happens to law, science, and the pursuit of social justice when such ideas and ideals are rejected? These questions are at the heart of the controversies between traditionalists and "postmodernists" that Barbara Herrnstein Smith examines in her wide-ranging book, which also offers an original perspective on the perennial--perhaps eternal--clash of belief and skepticism, on our need for intellectual stability and our experience of its inevitable disruption.   Focusing on the mutually frustrating impasses to which these controversies often lead and on the charges--"absurdity," "irrationalism," "complicity," "blindness," "stubbornness"--that typically accompany them, Smith stresses our tendency to give self-flattering reasons for our own beliefs and to discount or demonize the motives of those who disagree with us. Her account of the resulting cognitive and rhetorical dynamics of intellectual conflict draws on recent research and theory in evolutionary biology, neuroscience, developmental psychology, and the history and sociology of science, as well as on contemporary philosophy and language theory.   Smith's analyses take her into important ongoing debates over the possibility of an objective grounding of legal and political judgments, the continuing value of Enlightenment rationalism, significant challenges to dominant ideas of scientific truth, and proper responses to denials of the factuality of the Holocaust. As she explores these and other controversies, Smith develops fresh ways to understand their motives and energies, and more positive ways to see the operations of intellectual conflict more generally.},

However, recent scholarship suggests that creativity thrives in some industries in the absence of intellectual property protection. These industries might be called IP's negative spaces. One such industry that has received little scholarly attention is the typeface industry. This industry has recently digitized. Its adoption of digital processes has altered its market structure in ways that necessitate reconsideration of its IP negative status, with particular emphasis on copyright. This article considers the historical denial of copyright protection for typefaces in the United States, and examines arguments both for and against extending copyright protection to digital typefaces. It compares copyright law with alternative methods of protection for digital typefaces. It also suggests that the digital typeface industry may be a useful lens through which to consider broader claims about the application of intellectual property law to IP's negative spaces in the digital age.},

Une fois éclairci le sens littéral de ce passage des Remarques sur la philosophie de la psychologie, on peut s'interroger sur ce que Wittgenstein veut dire, dans le § 1096. Comme souvent chez l'auteur, on peut lire dans ce paragraphe une remarque grammaticale qui vise à éclaircir une difficulté philosophique : la possibilité de définir ce qu'est un calcul. In one of the very few writings of Wittgenstein's which are about Turing machines, the author writes that those « are human beings, who calculate ». The apparent strangeness of the aphorism disappears if we clear up some common misunderstandings about Turing machines. Once the literal meaning of this quotation from the Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology is made clear, we can try to understand what is really meant by § 1096. As is often the case in Wittgenstein's writings, it is possible to read this paragraph as a grammatical remark which aims at clearing up a philosophical issue : how to define « calculation ».},

Instances range over the whole of Western literature and thought, from Shakespeare to Hegel to Sartre, from Robespierre to R.D. Laing, suggesting the contradictions and ironies to which the ideals of sincerity and authenticity give rise, most especially in contemporary life. Lucid, and brilliantly framed, its view of cultural history will give Sincerity and Authenticity an important place among the works of this distinguished critic.},

	shorttitle = {Handbook of {Automated} {Essay} {Evaluation}},
	abstract = {This comprehensive, interdisciplinary handbook reviews the latest methods and technologies used in automated essay evaluation (AEE) methods and technologies. Highlights include the latest in the evaluation of performance-based writing assessments and recent advances in the teaching of writing, language testing, cognitive psychology, and computational linguistics. This greatly expanded follow-up to Automated Essay Scoring reflects the numerous advances that have taken place in the field since 2003 including automated essay scoring and diagnostic feedback. Each chapter features a common structure including an introduction and a conclusion. Ideas for diagnostic and evaluative feedback are sprinkled throughout the book.   Highlights of the book’s coverage include:   The latest research on automated essay evaluation.    Descriptions of the major scoring engines including the E-rater®, the Intelligent Essay Assessor, the IntellimetricTM Engine, c-raterTM, and LightSIDE.   Applications of the uses of the technology including a large scale system used in West Virginia.    A systematic framework for evaluating research and technological results.   Descriptions of AEE methods that can be replicated for languages other than English as seen in the example from China.    Chapters from key researchers in the field.   The book opens with an introduction to AEEs and a review of the "best practices" of teaching writing along with tips on the use of automated analysis in the classroom. Next the book highlights the capabilities and applications of several scoring engines including the E-rater®, the Intelligent Essay Assessor, the IntellimetricTM engine, c-raterTM, and LightSIDE. Here readers will find an actual application of the use of an AEE in West Virginia, psychometric issues related to AEEs such as validity, reliability, and scaling, and the use of automated scoring to detect reader drift, grammatical errors, discourse coherence quality, and the impact of human rating on AEEs. A review of the cognitive foundations underlying methods used in AEE is also provided. The book concludes with a comparison of the various AEE systems and speculation about the future of the field in light of current educational policy.  Ideal for educators, professionals, curriculum specialists, and administrators responsible for developing writing programs or distance learning curricula, those who teach using AEE technologies, policy makers, and researchers in education, writing, psychometrics, cognitive psychology, and computational linguistics, this book also serves as a reference for graduate courses on automated essay evaluation taught in education, computer science, language, linguistics, and cognitive psychology.},

	abstract = {Rapid advances in recording materials, read/write heads, and mechanical designs over the last 15 years have led to the need for more complicated signal processing, coding, and modulation algorithms for the hard disk drive "read channel." Today, the challenges in implementing new architectures and designs for the read channel have been pushed to the limits of modern integrated circuit manufacturing technology.Coding and Signal Processing for Magnetic Recording Systems reviews advanced coding and signal processing techniques and architectures for magnetic recording read channels. Beginning with the basic principles of magnetic recording, it examines read/write operations, data organization, head positioning, sensing, timing recovery, data detection, and error correction. It also provides an in-depth treatment of all recording channel subsystems inside a read channel and hard disk drive controller. The final section reviews new trends in coding, particularly iterative decoding and codes under investigation for recording channels.Thoroughly up to date and featuring contributions from top researchers in the field, this book offers a unique opportunity to build a solid foundation in detection, coding, timing recovery, and servo systems for magnetic recording systems. It provides both the theoretical tools for analyzing recording systems as well as insight into practical, feasible solutions.},

	abstract = {Advocates of computers make sweeping claims for their inherently transformative power: new and different from previous technologies, they are sure to resolve many of our existing social problems, and perhaps even to cause a positive political revolution.    In The Cultural Logic of Computation, David Golumbia, who worked as a software designer for more than ten years, confronts this orthodoxy, arguing instead that computers are cultural “all the way down”—that there is no part of the apparent technological transformation that is not shaped by historical and cultural processes, or that escapes existing cultural politics. From the perspective of transnational corporations and governments, computers benefit existing power much more fully than they provide means to distribute or contest it. Despite this, our thinking about computers has developed into a nearly invisible ideology Golumbia dubs “computationalism”—an ideology that informs our thinking not just about computers, but about economic and social trends as sweeping as globalization.    Driven by a programmer’s knowledge of computers as well as by a deep engagement with contemporary literary and cultural studies and poststructuralist theory, The Cultural Logic of Computation provides a needed corrective to the uncritical enthusiasm for computers common today in many parts of our culture.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-509829-7},
	abstract = {For decades educators and cultural critics have deplored the corrosive effects of electronic media on the national consciousness. The average American reads less often, writes less well. And, numbed by the frenetic image-bombardment of music videos, commercials and sound bites, we may also, it is argued, think less profoundly. But wait. Is it just possible that some good might arise from the ashes of the printed word?Most emphatically yes, argues Mitchell Stephens, who asserts that the moving image is likely to make our thoughts not more feeble but more robust. Through a fascinating overview of previous communications revolutions, Stephens demonstrates that the charges that have been leveled against television have been faced by most new media, including writing and print. Centuries elapsed before most of these new forms of communication would be used to produce works of art and intellect of sufficient stature to overcome this inevitable mistrust and nostalgia. Using examples taken from the history of photography and film, as well as MTV, experimental films, and Pepsi commercials, the author considers the kinds of work that might unleash, in time, the full power of moving images. And he argues that these works--an emerging computer-edited and -distributed "new video"--have the potential to inspire transformations in thought on a level with those inspired by the products of writing and print. Stephens sees in video's complexities, simultaneities, and juxtapositions, new ways of understanding and perhaps even surmounting the tumult and confusions of contemporary life.Sure to spark lively--even heated--debate, The Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word belongs in the library of millennium-watchers everywhere.},

	abstract = {The growth rate of scientific publication has been studied from 1907 to 2007 using available data from a number of literature databases, including Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50 years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for SCI up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that SCI was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by SCI is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that SCI has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in SSCI was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by SSCI was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on SCI, SSCI and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},

The basis of this conception was provided by his analysis of human action and the theory of gestural communication to which this led. Cultural products were seen as presupposing a collective subject and as acting back on the psychology of the individual. Although Wundt's conceptions had serious limitations some aspects of his thought about the relationship of individual and culture provide perspectives that are of continuing interest.},

However, more expressive models are desirable for more demanding applications that involve complex textual material and also nontextual objects, such as mathematical notation, tables, and figures. In this paper we present an expressive model, suitable for paper and electronic documents, that is based on a graph-like structure. The principal concepts are the notions of abstract and concrete objects, hierarchical composition of ordered and unordered objects, sharing of components, and reference links. This model has proven useful for specifying a wide variety of document objects, and is the basis for an implemented document preparation system.},

This paper describes three experiments which manipulated the degree of metaphor in VPLs. In the first, an implicit pictorial metaphor was added to a data flow language, while in the second and third an explicit explanatory metaphor was provided for diagrams showing computational concepts. In both cases, the performance of novices was compared to that of expert programmers, in order to judge the improvement in usability that might result from this instructional device. The resulting benefits of metaphor were smaller than expected especially relative to the advantage of experience. This suggests that metaphor may not be an essential component in the usability of VPLs},

It is argued here that the idea is more than a metaphor and is supported by theories that would view collections of documents and material artifacts as means of extending the temporal and spatial range of communication. Archives, along with other communicational resources such as oral and ritual tradition, help to transfer information--and thereby sustain memory--from generation to generation. Two examples illustrate the interrelationship of archives and memory within this broadened view of communication and culture. The first arises from attempts to find ways to warn future generations of the location of radioactive waste repositories. The second revolves around pressure to efface from cultural landscapes evidence of tragic events that people wish to forget.},

He regards the great perennial problems of criticism as arising not by the whim of a tolerantly pluralist choice, but from the nature of language and reality.With profound learning and insight, Wimsatt treats almost the whole range of literary criticism. The first group of essays deals with fallacies he believes are involved in prevalent approaches to the literary object. The next two groups face the responsibilities of the critic who defends literature as a form of knowledge; they treat various problems of structure and style. The last group undertakes to examine the relation of literature to other arts, the relation of evaluative criticism to historical studies, and the relation of literature not only to morals, but more broadly to the whole complex of the Christian religious tradition.},

An analogy can be drawn with the animal rights movement suggesting that, with enough complexity, androids may lay claim to some moral status even though this may be less than what is required for legal personhood. However, there are significant differences between animals and androids. Identifying similarities and differences, which may ultimately depend on how we come to conceive of human consciousness, will lead to an understanding of how our ideas about consciousness impact on our concept of rights. A moral dilemma may come early in android development, and when it does, it could have unexpected ramifications if not understood by researchers. Failure to be aware of this risk could result in reactions that curtail android science.},

	abstract = {In less than two decades the electronic digital computer has evolved from a high-speed replacement for the abacus to a full-fledged partner in dialogue with humans. By its very nature, on-line computing thrusts the user into an entirely different environment than does conventional batch processing. The problems inherent in a person's being made a system component---in a sense an extension of the computer hardware---were largely ignored until quite recently. Since the early users of on-line systems were highly skilled professionals who were both willing and able to communicate in terms most convenient for the machine, few programmers were aware of the user-computer communications gap, and even fewer were concerned about it. However, the lowered cost of computer access and the proliferation of on-line systems produced a new breed of users, people whose expertise was in some area other than computer technology. As their initial fascination with conversational computing wore off, users reported experiencing feelings of intense frustration and of being "manipulated" by a seemingly unyielding, rigid, intolerant dialogue partner, and these users began disconnecting from time-sharing services at a rate which was very alarming to the industry.},

	abstract = {Over the last seven years, we have developed static-analysis methods to recover a good approximation to the variables and dynamically allocated memory objects of a stripped executable, and to track the flow of values through them. The article presents the algorithms that we developed, explains how they are used to recover Intermediate Representations (IRs) from executables that are similar to the IRs that would be available if one started from source code, and describes their application in the context of program understanding and automated bug hunting. Unlike algorithms for analyzing executables that existed prior to our work, the ones presented in this article provide useful information about memory accesses, even in the absence of debugging information. The ideas described in the article are incorporated in a tool for analyzing Intel x86 executables, called CodeSurfer/x86. CodeSurfer/x86 builds a system dependence graph for the program, and provides a GUI for exploring the graph by (i) navigating its edges, and (ii) invoking operations, such as forward slicing, backward slicing, and chopping, to discover how parts of the program can impact other parts. To assess the usefulness of the IRs recovered by CodeSurfer/x86 in the context of automated bug hunting, we built a tool on top of CodeSurfer/x86, called Device-Driver Analyzer for x86 (DDA/x86), which analyzes device-driver executables for bugs. Without the benefit of either source code or symbol-table/debugging information, DDA/x86 was able to find known bugs (that had been discovered previously by source-code analysis tools), along with useful error traces, while having a low false-positive rate. DDA/x86 is the first known application of program analysis/verification techniques to industrial executables.},

	abstract = {Turing machines, first described by  Alan Turing in (Turing 1937),are simple abstract computational devices intended to help investigatethe extent and limitations of what can be computed., Turing was interested in the question of what it means for a task tobe computable, which is one of the foundational questions in the philosophy of computer science.Intuitively a task is computable if it is possible to specify a sequence ofinstructions which will result in the completion of thetask when they are carried out by some machine. Such a set ofinstructions is called an effective procedure,or algorithm, for the task. The problem with this intuitionis that what counts as an effective procedure may depend on thecapabilities of the machine used to carry out the instructions. Inprinciple, devices with different capabilities may be able to completedifferent instruction sets, and therefore may result in differentclasses of computable tasks (see the entryon computability and complexity)., Turing proposed a class of devices that came to be known as Turingmachines. These devices lead to a formal notion of computation that wewill call Turing-computability. A task is Turing computableif it can be carried out by some Turing machine., The proposition that Turing's notion captures exactly the intuitiveidea of effective procedure is called the  Church-Turing thesis.This proposition is not provable, since it is a claim about therelationship between a formal concept and intuition.  The thesis wouldbe refuted by an intuitively acceptable algorithm for a task that isnot Turing-computable, and no such counterexample has beenfound. Other independently defined notions of computability based onalternative foundations, such as recursive functions andabacus machines have been shown to be equivalent toTuring-computability. These two facts indicate that there is at leastsomething natural about this notion of computability., Turing machines are not physical objects but mathematical ones. Werequire neither soldering irons nor silicon chips to build one. Thearchitecture is simply described, and the actions that may be carriedout by the machine are simple and unambiguously specified. Turingrecognized that it is not necessary to talk about how themachine carries out its actions, but merely to take as given the twinideas that the machine can carry out the specified actions, and thatthose actions may be uniquely described.},

Now the Design and Research communities have access to multi-touch and gestural interfaces which have been released on a mass market scale. This allows them to design and develop new, unique, and richer design patterns and approaches. These methods are no longer confined to research projects or innovation labs, but are now offered on a large scale to millions of consumers. With these new interface behaviors, in combination with multiple types of hardware devices that can affect the interface, there are new problems and patterns that have increased the complexity of designing interfaces. The aim of this SIG is to provide a forum for Designers, Researchers, and Usability Professionals to discuss this new and emerging technology trends for multi-touch and gesture interfaces, as well as discuss current design patterns within these interfaces. Our goal is to cross pollinate ideas and current solutions from practitioners and researchers across communities to help drive awareness of this new field for those interested in, just starting in, or currently involved in the design of these systems.},

	abstract = {Lulled into somnolence by five hundred years of print, literary analysis should awaken to the importance of media-specific analysis, a mode of critical attention which recognizes that all texts are instantiated and that the nature of the medium in which they are instantiated matters. Central to repositioning critical inquiry, so it can attend to the specificity of the medium, is a more robust notion of materiality. Materiality is reconceptualized as the interplay between a text's physical characteristics and its signifying strategies, a move that entwines instantiation and signification at the outset. This definition opens the possibility of considering texts as embodied entities while still maintaining a central focus on interpretation. It makes materiality an emergent property, so that it cannot be specified in advance, as if it were a pregiven entity. Rather, materiality is open to debate and interpretation, ensuring that discussions about the text's“ meaning” will also take into account its physical specificity as well.
Following the emphasis on media-specific analysis, nine points can be made about the specificities of electronic hypertext: they are dynamic images; they include both analogue resemblance and digital coding; they are generated through fragmentation and recombination; they have depth and operate in three dimensions; they are written in code as well as natural language; they are mutable and transformable; they are spaces to navigate; they are written and read in distributed cognitive environments; and they initiate and demand cyborg reading practices.},

[1] The publications editor is divided into three related sections: the editing, document-layout, and printing facilities. The editing section is similar to "Typset" [2] in CTSS at M.I.T. with added features. It is a context editor with the added ability to edit by line number, and to edit with audit (the user may see and correct his recent changes and recover from what may have been a disastrous mistakeÂ¿see Fig. 2 of text). The most significant feature, however, is in the document layout. The layout facility is built upon a set of primitive requests. This set consists of requests for indentation, vertical spacing, margin control, justification, etc. The primitives can then be grouped to form more powerful requests. In the ability to group and the method of grouping lies the flexibility needed to produce different page layouts. The user may build a description from the primitives of what a paragraph, a heading, table of contents, etc., should look like in his document. This is a macro facility for document layout. In effect, a description of conventions to be used in laying out a documents, or class of documents, is placed in a file separate from the text (see Fig. 1 of text).},

Specifically geared towards an Anglophone readership, the paper relates the re-emergence of cultural techniques (a concept first employed in the 19th century in an agricultural context) to the changing intellectual constellation of postwar Germany. More specifically, it traces how the concept evolved from – and reacted against – so-called German media theory, a decidedly anti-hermeneutic and anti-humanist current of thought frequently associated with the work of Friedrich Kittler. Post-hermeneutic rather than anti-hermeneutic in its outlook, the reconceptualization of cultural techniques aims at presenting them as chains of operations that link humans, things, media and even animals. To investigate cultural techniques is to shift the analytic gaze from ontological distinctions to the ontic operations that gave rise to the former in the first place. As Siegert points out, this shift recalls certain concurrent developments within the North American posthumanities; the paper therefore also includes a discussion of the similarities and differences between German and North American posthumanism.},

Traditional tools, including hex editors, disassemblers and debuggers, while powerful, constrain analysis to primarily text based approaches. In this paper, we present design principles for file analysis which support meaningful investigation when there is little or no knowledge of the underlying file format, but are flexible enough to allow integration of additional semantic information, when available. We also present results from the implementation of a visual reverse engineering system based on our analysis. We validate the efficacy of both our analysis and our system with case studies depicting analysis use cases where a hex editor would be of limited value. Our results indicate that visual approaches help analysts rapidly identify files, analyze unfamiliar file structures, and gain insights that inform and complement the current suite of tools currently in use.},

	abstract = {Error has been the major metaphor for understanding delusions through the past three centuries. Modern definition of delusion as erroneous opinion or belief is evidence of the continuing role of this metaphor to this day. However, through long habituation the metaphorical nature of the association between delusion and error is no longer recognized. In other words, the metaphor has become literal and all but invisible. This paper seeks to shed light on this metaphor by tracing its development from inception in the seventeenth century to the present time. Also, the impact of the metaphor on modern research and therapeutic approaches is briefly discussed. Finally, to put the metaphor of error in perspective, some other metaphors applied to delusion over the years are reviewed.

The book expands Turing's original 36-page paper with additional background chapters and extensive annotations; the author elaborates on and clarifies many of Turing's statements, making the original difficult-to-read document accessible to present day programmers, computer science majors, math geeks, and others. Interwoven into the narrative are the highlights of Turing's own life: his years at Cambridge and Princeton, his secret work in cryptanalysis during World War II, his involvement in seminal computer projects, his speculations about artificial intelligence, his arrest and prosecution for the crime of "gross indecency," and his early death by apparent suicide at the age of 41.},

We can analyze relations between works on a single artist, many artists, all digitized production from a whole historical period, holdings in museum collections, collection metadata, or writings about art. The same concepts allow us to study contemporary vernacular visual media using massive social media content. (In our lab, we analyzed works by van Gogh, Mondrian, and Rothko, 6000 paintings by French Impressionists, 20,000 photographs from MoMA photo­graphy collection, one million manga pages from manga books, one million artworks of contemporary non-professional artists, and over 13 million Instagram images from 16 global cities.) While data science techniques do not replace other art historical methods, they allow us to see familiar art historical material in new ways, and also to study contemporary digital visual culture.},

We propose a novel solution to this problem, which regularizes a statistical topic model with a harmonic regularizer based on a graph structure in the data. The proposed method bridges topic modeling and social network analysis, which leverages the power of both statistical topic models and discrete regularization. The output of this model well summarizes topics in text, maps a topic on the network, and discovers topical communities. With concrete selection of a topic model and a graph-based regularizer, our model can be applied to text mining problems such as author-topic analysis, community discovery, and spatial text mining. Empirical experiments on two different genres of data show that our approach is effective, which improves text-oriented methods as well as network-oriented methods. The proposed model is general; it can be applied to any text collections with a mixture of topics and an associated network structure.},

The authors maintain that learning viewed as situated activity has as its central defining characteristic a process they call legitimate peripheral participation. Learners participate in communities of practitioners, moving toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. Legitimate peripheral participation provides a way to speak about crucial relations between newcomers and oldtimers and about their activities, identities, artifacts, knowledge and practice. The communities discussed in the book are midwives, tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering alcoholics, however, the process by which participants in those communities learn can be generalized to other social groups.},

Lines of text from the typewriter terminal are put into canonical form and added to or inserted in the file. Editing instructions can reference a line either by context or relative line number, and can change strings within the line to other strings, as well as retype, delete, or insert whole lines. The PRINT module formats the manuscript file and outputs it to either the typewriter or line printer. Lines are left and right justified by adding additional embedded blanks where necessary. A logical topology data structure correctly interprets overprinting characters. Format control lines may be inserted in the text to specify such additional features as heading lines, line length, page length, page numbering, centering, indentation, and double spacing.

	abstract = {This paper explores the ontology of digital information or the nature of digital-being. Even though a digital-being is not a physical thing, it has many essential features of physical things such as substantiality, extensions, and thing-totality (via Heidegger). Despite their lack of material bases, digital-beings can provide us with perceivedness or universal passive pregivenness (via Husserl). Still, a digital-being is not exactly a thing, because it does not belong to objective time and space. Due to its perfect duplicability, a digital being can exist at multiple locations simultaneously-that is, it defies normal spatiotemporal constraints. With digital beings on the Internet, we can establish intercorporeal relationships. The World Wide Web opens up new possibilities of Dasein's "being-able-to-be-with-one-another" and new modes of "Being-with-others" (Mitsein). The new modes of communication based on digital-beings compel us to re-read Heidegger's basic concepts such as "Dasein as Being-in-the-world," since Dasein becomes the "Digi-sein as Being-in-the-World-Wide-Web." By exploring the ontological characteristics of digital-being, this paper suggests that we conceive digital-beings as res digitalis -- a third entity which is located somewhere between res cogitans and res extensa.},

	abstract = {This article can be viewed as an attempt to explore the consequences of two propositions. (1) Intentionality in human beings (and animals) is a product of causal features of the brain. I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal powers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4.“Could a machine think?” On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking.},

The basic technologies of electronics, virtual machines, and software have gone through cycles of breakthrough, replication, empiricism, theory, automation and maturity. HCI entered its period of theoretical consolidation at the beginning of the fifth generation in 1980. The lists of pragmatic dialog rules for HCI in the fourth generation have served their purpose, and effort should now be directed to the underlying foundations.

Caroline Levine argues that forms organize not only works of art but also political life--and our attempts to know both art and politics. Inescapable and frequently troubling, forms shape every aspect of our experience. But forms don't impose their order in any simple way. Multiple shapes, patterns, and arrangements, overlapping and colliding, generate complex and unpredictable social landscapes that challenge and unsettle conventional analytic models in literary and cultural studies. Borrowing the concept of "affordances" from design theory, this book investigates the specific ways that four major forms--wholes, rhythms, hierarchies, and networks--have structured culture, politics, and scholarly knowledge across periods, and it proposes exciting new ways of linking formalism to historicism and literature to politics. Levine rereads both formalist and antiformalist theorists, including Cleanth Brooks, Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Mary Poovey, and Judith Butler, and she offers engaging accounts of a wide range of objects, from medieval convents and modern theme parks to Sophocles's Antigone and the television series The Wire. The result is a radically new way of thinking about form for the next generation and essential reading for scholars and students across the humanities who must wrestle with the problem of form and context"--},

We argue that neuroscience will probably have a transformative effect on the law, despite the fact that existing legal doctrine can, in principle, accommodate whatever neuroscience will tell us. New neuroscience will change the law, not by undermining its current assumptions, but by transforming people's moral intuitions about free will and responsibility. This change in moral outlook will result not from the discovery of crucial new facts or clever new arguments, but from a new appreciation of old arguments, bolstered by vivid new illustrations provided by cognitive neuroscience.

	issn = {0378-8733},
	abstract = {Quantification of human group-behavior has so far defied an empirical, falsifiable approach. This is due to tremendous difficulties in data acquisition of social systems. Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players over a period of 3 years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual income through economic activities to 'survive' and are typically engaged in a multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files focuses on three types of social networks, and tests a series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In particular we study the structure and dynamics of friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find striking differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative (enemy) tie networks. All networks confirm the recently observed phenomenon of network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the overlap. These empirical laws provide strong quantitative evidence for the Weak ties hypothesis of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad significance profiles validates well-established assertions from social balance theory. We find overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete (incomplete) triads in networks of positive ties, and vice versa for networks of negative ties. Empirical transition probabilities between triad classes provide evidence for triadic closure with extraordinarily high precision. For the first time we provide empirical results for large-scale networks of negative social ties. Whenever possible we compare our findings with data from non-virtual human groups and provide further evidence that online game communities serve as a valid model for a wide class of human societies. With this setup we demonstrate the feasibility for establishing a 'socio-economic laboratory' which allows to operate at levels of precision approaching those of the natural sciences.All data used in this study is fully anonymized; the authors have the written consent to publish from the legal department of the Medical University of Vienna. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

It expands prior research that limited its focus on the position of co-authors and incorporates the effects of the use of knowledge sources within articles: references. By creating a network on the basis of shared references, we propose a way to understand whether an article bridges among extant strands of literature and infer the size of its research community and its embeddedness. Thus, we map onto the article – our unit of analysis – the metrics of authors' position in the co-authorship network and of the use of knowledge on which the scientific article is grounded. Specifically, we adopt centrality measures – degree, betweenneess, and closeness centrality – in the co-authorship network and degree, betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient in the bibliographic coupling and show their influence on the citations received in first two years after the year of publication. Findings show that authors' degree positively impacts citations. Also closeness centrality has a positive effect manifested only when the giant component is relevant. Author's betweenness centrality has instead a negative effect that persists until the giant component - largest component of the network in which all nodes can be linked by a path - is relevant. Moreover, articles that draw on fragmented strands of literature tend to be cited more, whereas the size of the scientific research community and the embeddedness of the article in a cohesive cluster of literature have no effect.},

How can such measures reflect the fact that summaries conveying different content can be equally good and informative? In this article, we address these very questions by proposing a method for analysis of multiple human abstracts into semantic content units. Such analysis allows us not only to quantify human variation in content selection, but also to assign empirical importance weight to different content units. It serves as the basis for an evaluation method, the Pyramid Method, that incorporates the observed variation and is predictive of different equally informative summaries. We discuss the reliability of content unit annotation, the properties of Pyramid scores, and their correlation with other evaluation methods.},

Guerrilla Metaphysics makes the opposite assertion, challenging the dominant "philosophy of access" (both continental and analytic) that remains quarantined in discussions of language, perception, or literary texts. Philosophy needs a fresh resurgence of the things themselves—not merely the words or appearances themselves.   Once these themes are adapted to the needs of an object-oriented philosophy, what emerges is a brand new type of metaphysics—a "guerrilla metaphysics."},

The most central and complex symbol in your brain is the one called “I.” The “I” is the nexus in our brain, one of many symbols seeming to have free will and to have gained the paradoxical ability to push particles around, rather than the reverse.How can a mysterious abstraction be real—or is our “I” merely a convenient fiction? Does an “I” exert genuine power over the particles in our brain, or is it helplessly pushed around by the laws of physics?These are the mysteries tackled in I Am a Strange Loop, Douglas Hofstadter’s first book-length journey into philosophy since Gödel, Escher, Bach.

AmI creates an environment that monitors and anticipates human behaviour with the aim of customised adaptation of the environment to a person’s inferred preferences. Such an environment depends on distributed human and non-human intelligence that raises a host of unsettling questions around causality, subjectivity, agency and (criminal) liability. After discussing the vision of AmI we will present relevant research in the field of philosophy of technology, inspired by the post-phenomenological position taken by Don Ihde and the constructivist realism of Bruno Latour. We will posit the need to conceptualise technological normativity in comparison with legal normativity, claiming that this is necessary to develop democratic accountability for the implications of emerging technologies like AmI. Lastly we will investigate to what extent technological devices and infrastructures can and should be used to achieve compliance with the criminal law, and we will discuss some of the implications of non-human distributed intelligence for criminal liability.},

	abstract = {Khlebnikov, who died in 1922 at the age of thirty-six, is one of the great, untranslated Russian poets of this century. Hailed by his contemporaries and by later writers and scholars as the creative genius behind the Russian Futurist movement, Khlebnikov is famous more for his inaccessibility than for the excellence of what he actually produced. Even Russians are generally baffled by him.Now, in a powerful American rendition, we are given access to the strange and beautiful world of Khlebnikos "the word's wild highwayman." Trained in the natural sciences and mathematics and by temperament an artist, Khlebnikov thought he had discovered the Laws of Time and Tables of Destiny, by which enlightened humans could live in harmony with themselves and with nature. He coined the terms "Futurian" and "Presidents of Planet Earth" for himself and his friends, and he devoted all of his short, restless life to finding a language appropriate to his vision. Experiments with words became magical paths to a reinvigorated future, and produced some of the most extraordinary poems in the Russian language.These goals and researches were variously embodied as well in stories, plays, and visionary essays in which Khlebnikov advances architectural plans for mobile cities, a new alphabet based on universal meanings of sounds, and communication by way of vast television networks. The result is poetry of startling originality, modernity, and linguistic virtuosity--a true challenge to translators and one that has been met brilliantly here by Schmidt and Douglas.The King of Time is a representative sampling of Khlebnikov's writings, taken from the translation of his complete works now in preparation under the auspices of the Dia Art Foundation. It includes many pieces, among them the full text of the astounding poem-play Zangezi, never before translated. General readers will be introduced to the legendary Khlebnikov, and cognoscenti will applaud the inventiveness of the rendering.Paul Schmidt, translator of Rimbaud and Mayakovsky among others, and Charlotte Douglas, an art historian who specializes in the Russian avant-garde, are Director and Senior Research Scholar, Khlehnikov Translation Project, Dia Art Foundation.},

	abstract = {The paper argues that digital ontology (the ultimate nature of reality is digital, and the universe is a computational system equivalent to a Turing Machine) should be carefully distinguished from informational ontology (the ultimate nature of reality is structural), in order to abandon the former and retain only the latter as a promising line of research. Digital vs. analogue is a Boolean dichotomy typical of our computational paradigm, but digital and analogue are only "modes of presentation" of Being (to paraphrase Kant), that is, ways in which reality is experienced or conceptualised by an epistemic agent at a given level of abstraction. A preferable alternative is provided by an informational approach to structural realism, according to which knowledge of the world is knowledge of its structures. The most reasonable ontological commitment turns out to be in favour of an interpretation of reality as the totality of structures dynamically interacting with each other. The paper is the first part (the pars destruens) of a two-part piece of research. The pars construens, entitled "A Defence of Informational Structural Realism", is developed in a separate article, also published in this journal.},

Among the most complex and original analyses of the character of philosophic inquiry and the relation of the possibility of such inquiry to the human situation, Being and Time has long been recognized as a landmark work of the twentieth century. Still provocative and much disputed, Heidegger's text has been taken as the inspiration for a variety of innovative movements in fields ranging from psychoanalysis, literary theory, existentialism, ethics, hermeneutics, and theology. A work that disturbs the traditions of philosophizing that it inherits, Being and Time raises questions about the end of philosophy and the possibilities for thinking liberated from the presumptions of metaphysics. This new translation by Joan Stambaugh, one of Heidegger's students and leading interpreters, takes account of English-language Heidegger research since the first translation of Being and Time in 1962.},

Handsetting metal type necessarily focuses one's attention on the specificity of written language as a sequence of discrete letters. Each has properties of size, weight and shape; and placement and type styles can be widely varied. The technical constraints of letterpress tend to conserve the norm in the representation of language: line after straight line of a single typeface. The author's intention in deviating from these norms has been to extend, rather than negate or deny, the possibilities of meaning by encouraging plural readings at the levels of the word, the line and the page. Other issues such as the relation of language to experience, to literary tradition or to the social context in which it is produced are investigated.},

For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes various modes of "surface reading" that together strive to accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness. Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been rendered invisible by symptomatic reading.},

This volume, with a new and extensive introduction by D. H. Mellor, contains all Ramsey's previously published writings on philosophy and the foundations of mathematics. The latter gives the definitive form and defence of the reduction of mathematics to logic undertaken in Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica; the former includes the most profound and original studies of universals, truth, meaning, probability, knowledge, law and causation, all of which are still constantly referred to, and still essential reading for all serious students of these subjects.},

We compare two classes of processing algorithms: those that begin by accessing or deriving an abstraction from the base (orvehicle) and then project it to the target (ortopic) and those that begin by aligning the representations of the terms and then project further inferences from the base to the target. To decide between these accounts, we recorded subjects’ time to interpret metaphors primed by either the base term or the target term (or both or neither). Abstraction-based models predict that priming by the base should lead to faster metaphor comprehension than priming by the target; alignment-based models predict no such advantage. Across a series of experiments, the results were most consistent with alignment-first processing. No base advantage was found, with the single exception of metaphors having highly conventional meanings and low (metaphorical) similarity. Further, high-similarity metaphors were interpreted faster than low-similarity metaphors, consistent with the alignment view. We conjecture that this pattern may result from a shift in processing with conventionalization: novel metaphors may be understood by alignment and conventional metaphors by abstraction.},

In particular, it analyzes the Cahier Rouge (1850–1860), Bernard's acclaimed laboratory notebook. In this notebook, Bernard articulates the range of his experience as an experimental physiologist, juxtaposing without differentiation details of laboratory procedure and more personal queries, doubts, and reflections on experimentation, life, and art. Bernard's insights, it is argued, offer an aesthetic and phenomenological template for considering experimentation. His physiological point of view ranges from his own bodily aesthesis or sensory perception, through personal reflections on scientific discovery as an artistic process, to a broader metaphysical conception of life as an artistic creation. Such an aesthetic approach to physiology enables Bernard to reconcile his empirical methodology and his romantic idealism; it offers the history of laboratory science a framework for considering the individual, bodily, and emotional labor inherent in physiological experimentation.},

In order to do so, we also need to understand the approaches our intellectual forefathers applied. The present article brings to light a ‘forgotten’ approach to studying people bound by common language, myth and customs. Völkerpsychologie is the historical predecessor to cultural psychology; however, readers not familiar with the history of psychology may not know what this ‘forgotten’ discipline attempted to achieve. The article focuses on Völkerpsychologie as its founders, Lazarus and Steinthal, conceived of it (including the often overlooked continuation of their journal after 1890), as well as Wilhelm Wundt’s considerable contributions to the discipline. Possible new directions for this approach are suggested in order to make it more suitable for 21st-century cultural psychology.},

Following Descartes' dictum that it is the ability to speak that distinguishes human from beast, Turing suggested testing whether machine and person were indistinguishable in regard to verbal ability. He was not, as is often assumed, answering the question "Can machines think?" but offering a more concrete way to ask it.

It is suggested that textual analysis needs to be based upon a multifunctional theory of language such as systematic-functional linguistics. Finally, the paper suggests theoretical, methodological, historical and political reasons why textual analysis ought to be more widely recognized as a method in social research.},

	abstract = {Producers of digital media works increasingly employ technological protection measures, commonly referred to as "digital rights management" (or "DRM") technologies, that prevent the works from being accessed or used except upon conditions the producers themselves specify.  These technologies have come under criticism for interfering with the rights users enjoy under copyright law, including the right to engage in fair uses of the DRM-protected works.  Most DRM mechanisms are not engineered to include exceptions for fair use, and user circumvention of the DRM may violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act even if the use for which the circumvention occurs is itself noninfringing.  The academic literature on fair use in digital media has suggested several possible ways to resolve the tension between fair use on the one hand and DRM on the other.  Among the more provocative possibilities is that DRM technologies themselves may evolve to incorporate greater built-in protections for end-user rights.  This article examines several such proposals and finds that they are not likely to provide users with the same measure of protections for fair use of copyrighted works that exists in the offline world.  The failure of these proposals, however, does not suggest that the broader goal of protecting fair use rights in digital media is unattainable.  It is possible to advance much more closely towards that goal by altering the design philosophy of DRM technologies to focus more on the processes by which fair uses occur and less on attempting to replicate the substantive law of fair use in machine-administrable form.  The article concludes by outlining one possible system engineered to protect the process of fair use.},

In the 1940s and '50s, a group of eccentric geniuses, led by John von Neumann, gathered at the newly created Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Their joint project was the realization of the theoretical universal machine, an idea that had been put forth by mathematician Alan Turing. Their work would break the distinction between numbers that mean things and numbers that do things. They achieved unprecedented success in both weather prediction and nuclear weapons design, while tackling problems ranging from the evolution of viruses to the evolution of stars. This group of brilliant engineers worked in isolation, almost entirely independent from industry and the traditional academic community. But because they relied exclusively on government funding, the government wanted its share of the results: the computer that they built also led directly to the hydrogen bomb. The author has uncovered a wealth of new material about this project, and in bringing the story of these men and women and their ideas to life, he shows how the crucial advancements that dominated twentieth-century technology emerged from one computer in one laboratory, where the digital universe as we know it was born. "Legendary historian and philosopher of science George Dyson vividly re-creates the scenes of focused experimentation, incredible mathematical insight, and pure creative genius that gave us computers, digital television, modern genetics, models of stellar evolution--in other words, computer code"--},

He then considers the introduction of commercial interactive fiction for home computers, particularly that produced by Infocom. Commercial works inspired an independent reaction, and Montfort describes the emergence of independent creators and the development of an online interactive fiction community in the 1990s. Finally, he considers the influence of interactive fiction on other literary and gaming forms.

This critique is based firstly on data about the composition of various government organs, institutions and the principal journals in the field, and secondly on a general reflection on the cultural, political and linguistic bias of digital standards, protocols and interfaces. These reflections suggest that DH is not only a discipline and an academic discourse dominated materially by an Anglo-American élite and intellectually by a mono-cultural view, but also that it lacks a theoretical model for reflecting critically on its own instruments. I conclude by proposing the elaboration of a different model of DH, based on the concept of knowledge as a commons and the cultivation of cultural margins, as opposed to its present obsession with large-scale digitization projects and "archiving fever," that leads to an increase in our dependency on the products of private industry and, of course, on their funding.},

Experiment 4 showed evidence of figurative activation for most LF and moderate-apt metaphors. The locus of activation was investigated in Experiment 5 in which the individual words of the metaphor (topic and vehicle) served as primes. Neither topic nor vehicle showed evidence of priming the metaphor target, suggesting that activation of the metaphorical target in Experiments 1-4 was not caused by lexical activation of the words within the metaphors, but rather was due to activation of emergent properties of the metaphorical phrase.},

This processing is done manually in many applications. Thus, such inputs as punched cards, magnetic tape, and punched paper tape often are the result of a manual processing operation in which a human being is required to inspect visually an array of printed characters and to describe these data in a form capable of being processed by machine. In recognition of the importance of automating such operations, many investigations have been undertaken to devise automatic character sensing equipment. Suppose, however, that we attempt to view such efforts in proper perspective. We find a more fundamental problem that has, heretofore, failed to receive the attention that it warrants. The problem is one of making directly available to a computer pictorial information which would ordinarily be visually processed by human beings before being fed to a data processing system. This pictorial information may range from such highly stylized forms as printed characters, diagrams, schematic drawings, emblems, and designs through less stylized forms in cartoons and handwritten characters to such highly amorphous forms as photographs of real objects, e.g., people, aerial views, and microscopic and telescopic images.},

	abstract = {“One of the most exciting developments from the world of ideas in decades, presented with panache by two frighteningly brilliant, endearingly unpretentious, and endlessly creative young scientists.” – Steven Pinker, author of The Better Angels of Our Nature     Our society has gone from writing snippets of information by hand to generating a vast flood of 1s and 0s that record almost every aspect of our lives: who we know, what we do, where we go, what we buy, and who we love. This year, the world will generate 5 zettabytes of data. (That’s a five with twenty-one zeros after it.) Big data is revolutionizing the sciences, transforming the humanities, and renegotiating the boundary between industry and the ivory tower.       What is emerging is a new way of understanding our world, our past, and possibly, our future. In Uncharted, Erez Aiden and Jean-Baptiste Michel tell the story of how they tapped into this sea of information to create a new kind of telescope: a tool that, instead of uncovering the motions of distant stars, charts trends in human history across the centuries. By teaming up with Google, they were able to analyze the text of millions of books. The result was a new field of research and a scientific tool, the Google Ngram Viewer, so groundbreaking that its public release made the front page of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Boston Globe, and so addictive that Mother Jones called it “the greatest timewaster in the history of the internet.”       Using this scope, Aiden and Michel—and millions of users worldwide—are beginning to see answers to a dizzying array of once intractable questions. How quickly does technology spread? Do we talk less about God today? When did people start “having sex” instead of “making love”? At what age do the most famous people become famous? How fast does grammar change? Which writers had their works most effectively censored by the Nazis? When did the spelling “donut” start replacing the venerable “doughnut”? Can we predict the future of human history? Who is better known—Bill Clinton or the rutabaga?       All over the world, new scopes are popping up, using big data to quantify the human experience at the grandest scales possible. Yet dangers lurk in this ocean of 1s and 0s—threats to privacy and the specter of ubiquitous government surveillance. Aiden and Michel take readers on a voyage through these uncharted waters.},

The ease and directness of JOSS is attributable to an interpretive routine in the JOHNNIAC computer which responds quickly to instructions expressed in a simple language and transmitted over telephone lines from convenient remote electric-typewriter consoles. An evaluation of the system has shown that in spite of severe constraints on speed and size of program, and the use of an aging machine of the vacuumtube era, JOSS provides a valuable service for computational needs which cannot be satisfied by conventional, closed-shop practice.},

Is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? In this startling and lavishly illustrated book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about these and other abiding mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by brilliance and simplicity. According to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history. The authors explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature. They conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a “theory of everything”: the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, which, if confirmed, would represent the ultimate triumph of human reason.},

cannot be efficiently processed or stored using today's mobile devices. Parallel to this explosive growth in data, a

substantial increase in mobile compute-capability and the advances in cloud computing have brought the state-of-the-

art in mobile-cloud computing to an inflection point, where the right architecture may allow mobile devices to

run applications utilizing Big Data and intensive computing. In this paper, we propose the MObile Cloud-based

Hybrid Architecture (MOCHA), which formulates a solution to permit mobile-cloud computing applications such

as object recognition in the battlefield by introducing a mid-stage compute- and storage-layer, called the cloudlet.

MOCHA is built on the key observation that many mobile-cloud applications have the following characteristics:

1) they are compute-intensive, requiring the compute-power of a supercomputer, and 2) they use Big Data,

requiring a communications link to cloud-based database sources in near-real-time. In this paper, we describe

the operation of MOCHA in battlefield applications, by formulating the aforementioned mobile and cloudlet to

be housed within a soldier's vest and inside a military vehicle, respectively, and enabling access to the cloud

through high latency satellite links. We provide simulations using the traditional mobile-cloud approach as well

as utilizing MOCHA with a mid-stage cloudlet to quantify the utility of this architecture. We show that the

MOCHA platform for mobile-cloud computing promises a future for critical battlefield applications that access

Big Data, which is currently not possible using existing technology.},

This book reveals the germination and growth of the ideas which found their final expression in Witgenstein's later work. It is indispensable therefore to students of Witgenstein's thought and to all those who wish to study at first-hand the mental processes of a thinker who fundamentally changed the course of modern philosophy.},

	shorttitle = {Deconstruction in a {Nutshell}},
	abstract = {Responding to questions put to him at a Roundtable held at Villanova University in 1994, Jacques Derrida leads the reader through an illuminating discussion of the central themes of deconstruction. Speaking in English and extemporaneously, Derrida takes up with unusual clarity and great eloquence such topics as the task of philosophy, the Greeks, justice, responsibility, the gift, the community, the distinction between the messianic and the concrete messianisms, and his interpretation of James Joyce. Derrida convincingly refutes the charges of relativism and nihilism that are often leveled at deconstruction by its critics and sets forth the profoundly affirmative and ethico-political thrust of his work. The Roundtableis marked by the unusual clarity of Derrida's presentation and by the deep respect for the great works of the philosophical and literary tradition with which he characterizes his philosophical work. The Roundtable is annotated by John D. Caputo, the David R. Cook Professor of Philosophy at Villanova University, who has supplied cross references to Derrida's writings where the reader may find further discussion on these topics. Professor Caputo has also supplied a commentary which elaborates the principal issues raised in the Roundtable. In all, this volume represents one of the most lucid, compact and reliable introductions to Derrida and deconstruction available in any language. An ideal volume for students approaching Derrida for the first time, Deconstruction in a Nutshell will prove instructive and illuminating as well for those already familiar with Derrida's work.},

	abstract = {Book piracy is an illegal and illegitimate reproduction of other people's intellectual property for economic reasons without prior consent or authorization. This paper examines the intricate dimension of book piracy in the Nigerian Publishing Industry. It notes the dangers the trend portends to qualitative education and scholarship in general. The paper identifies the different forms of book piracy as: local reproduction of fast moving titles using newsprint or poor textured paper, abuse of publication rights, hi-tech reproduction overseas, circumventing the e-book version, illegal reprography, unauthorized excessive production by printers, and translation without permission. Some of the causes of book piracy are poverty, book scarcity, ignorance of the copyright laws by the public and the uncooperative attitude of some countries in endorsing international treaties on intellectual property rights. The paper recommends the following as panacea to stemming the tide of the menace: cost reduction strategies, national book policy and commissioning of local authorship, awareness and enforcement of copyright laws, revitalization of libraries, sanctions on countries showing complacency towards piracy, special algorithms to detect illegal downloads, security printing devices and moral suasion.},

Moreover, it is at last becoming possible technologically to enhance these skills in man by incorporating somewhat similar evolutionary skills in the machines which we design and build. However, if engineers are to develop machines with evolutionary capabilities, they will need to restructure their own way of thinking, throw out traditional ways of thinking, and find their way, through playing with evolutionary design techniques, into an ever-deepening understanding of the significance of such techniques. They must bootstrap themselves into a new kind of “think,” into a new climate of man-machine interaction, in which men evolve intelligent machines and intelligent machines evolve men. This new kind of think is what this article tries to unfold in an effort to spur lively support for the evolutionary direction.},

The data compiled and portaits created are incredibly detailed, to the oint of being invasive. But who connects the dots about what firms are doing with this information? The Black Box Society argues that we all need to be able to do so - and to set limits on how big data affects our lives. Hidden algorithms can make (or ruin) reputations, decide the destiny of entrepreneurs, or even devastate an entire economy. Shrouded in secrecy and complexity, decisions at major Silicon Valley and Wall Street firms were long assumed to be neutral and technical. But leaks, whistleblowers, and legal disputes have shed new light on automated judgment. Self-serving and reckless behavior is surprisingly common, and easy to hide in code protected by legal and real secrecy. Even after billions of dollars of fines have been levied, underfunded regulators may have only scratched the surface of this troubling behavior. Frank Pasquale exposes how powerful interests abuse secrecy for profit and explains ways to rein them in. Demanding transparency is only the first step. An intelligible society would assure that key decisions of its most important firms are fair, nondiscriminatory, and open to criticism. Silicon Valley and Wall Street need to accept as much accountability as they impose on others. -- from dust jacket.},

As more and more of our textual communication moves into the digital realm we have reached a crucial moment in the history of textual transmission. In many respects digital text looks deceptively like print. But beneath the surface of the screen, digital textuality obeys very different rules than printed text. The digital textual universe offers a wealth of new and exciting possibilities - but it also sets new rules for the writer\&\#8217;s and reader\&\#8217;s engagement with text. Changing our textual minds analyses the continuities and discontinuities in textual transmission as we move from a print paradigm into an increasingly digital world. It conceptualizes the epochal transition from analogue to digital both in factual terms and in terms of its social significance. Centuries of reading and writing practice have made us Homo typographicus. Our entire way of disseminating knowledge and culture is firmly based on print culture. The need to come to grips with the shift to digital textuality in the early twenty-first century will literally change our minds.},

We consider their primary products, use of formalism, and abstraction objectives, and find that the two disciplines are sharply distinguished. Mathematics, being primarily concerned with developing inference structures, has information neglect as its abstraction objective. Computer science, being primarily concerned with developing interaction patterns, has information hiding as its abstraction objective. We show that abstraction through information hiding is a primary factor in computer science progress and success through an examination of the ubiquitous role of information hiding in programming languages, operating systems, network architecture, and design patterns.},

Prior studies have primarily focused on students’ capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers’ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.},

Whether examining late nineteenth century commercial, or "job" printing, or the Xerox machine and the role of reproduction in our understanding of the document, Gitelman reveals a keen eye for vernacular uses of technology. She tells nuanced, anecdote-filled stories of the waning of old technologies and the emergence of new. Along the way, she discusses documentary matters such as the relation between twentieth-century technological innovation and the management of paper, and the interdependence of computer programming and documentation. Paper Knowledge is destined to set a new agenda for media studies" -- From the publisher.},

He presents practical techniques for text processing, locating text boundaries, searching, sorting, rendering text, accepting user input, and other key development tasks. Along the way, he offers specific guidance on integrating Unicode with other technologies, including Java, JavaScript, XML, and the Web.

There are hundreds of different encoding systems for mapping characters to numbers, but Unicode promises a single mapping. Unicode enables a single software product or website to be targeted across multiple platforms, languages and countries without re-engineering. It's no wonder that industry giants like Apple, Hewlett-Packard, IBM andMicrosoft have all adopted Unicode. Containing everything you need to understand Unicode, this comprehensive reference from O'Reilly takes you on a detailed guide through the complex character world. For starters, it explains how to identify and classify characters - whether they're common, uncommon, or exotic. It then shows you how to type them, utilize their properties, and process character data in a robust manner.  The book is broken up into three distinct parts. The first few chapters provide you with a tutorial presentation of Unicode and character data. It gives you a firm grasp of the terminology you need to reference various components, including character sets, fonts and encodings, glyphs and character repertoires. The middle section offers more detailed information about using Unicode and other character codes. It explains the principles and methods of defining character codes, describes some of the widely used codes, and presents code conversion techniques. It also discusses properties of characters, collation and sorting, line breaking rules and Unicode encodings. The final four chapters cover more advanced material, suchas programming to support Unicode. You simply can't afford to be without the nuggets of valuable information detailed in Unicode Explained.},

In their sharing of the term, both kinds of clouds reveal an essential truth: that the natural world and the technological world are not so distinct. In The Marvelous Clouds, John Durham Peters argues that though we often think of media as environments, the reverse is just as true - environments are media. Peters defines media expansively as elements that compose the human world. Drawing from ideas implicit in media philosophy, Peters argues that media are more than carriers of messages: they are the very infrastructures combining nature and culture that allow human life to thrive. Through an encyclopedic array of examples from the oceans to the skies, The Marvelous Clouds reveals the long prehistory of so-called new media. Digital media, Peters argues, are an extension of early practices tied to the establishment of civilization such as mastering fire, building calendars, reading the stars, creating language, and establishing religions. New media do not take us into uncharted waters, but rather confront us with the deepest and oldest questions of society and ecology: how to manage the relations people have with themselves, others, and the natural world. A wide-ranging meditation on the many means we have employed to cope with the struggles of existence - from navigation to farming, meteorology to Google - The Marvelous Clouds shows how media lie at the very heart of our interactions with the world around us. Peters's book will not only change how we think about media but provide a new appreciation for the day-to-day foundations of life on earth that we so often take for granted. -- from dust jacket.},

Beyond their acknowledged editorial and archival capabilities, digital media are also critical tools of unprecedented power. In McGann’s practical vision, digital tools give scholars a flexible, dynamic means for interpreting expressive works—especially those that combine text and image.

	abstract = {Interoperability is widely touted for its ability to spur incremental innovation, increase competition and consumer choice, and decrease barriers to accessibility.  In light of these attributes, intellectual property law generally permits follow-on innovators to create products that interoperate with existing systems, even without permission. The anticircumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") represent a troubling departure from this policy, resulting in patent-like rights to exclude technologies that interoperate with protected platforms. Although the DMCA contains internal safeguards to preserve interoperability, judicial misinterpretation and narrow statutory text render those safeguards largely ineffective.   One approach to counteracting the DMCA's restrictions on interoperability is to rely on antitrust scrutiny and the resulting mandatory disclosure of technical information.  But both doctrinal and policy considerations suggest that antitrust offers a less than ideal means of lessening the DMCA's impact on interoperability. Rather than relying on antitrust, this Article proposes a solution that addresses the restriction of interoperability at its source. This approach broadens the DMCA's existing interoperability exemption to create an environment more hospitable to interoperable technologies. To preserve the protections the DMCA offers copyright holders, this expanded exemption would disaggregate control over interoperable software and devices from the control over access and copying that Congress intended the DMCA to enable.},

	title = {Gaussian processes for machine learning},
	abstract = {Abstract. We give a basic introduction to Gaussian Process regression models. We focus on understanding the role of the stochastic process and how it is used to define a distribution over functions. We present the simple equations for incorporating training data and examine how to learn the hyperparameters using the marginal likelihood. We explain the practical advantages of Gaussian Process and end with conclusions and a look at the current trends in GP work. Supervised learning in the form of regression (for continuous outputs) and classification (for discrete outputs) is an important constituent of statistics and machine learning, either for analysis of data sets, or as a subgoal of a more complex problem. Traditionally parametric 1 models have been used for this purpose. These have a possible advantage in ease of interpretability, but for complex data sets, simple parametric models may lack expressive power, and their more complex counterparts (such as feed forward neural networks) may not be easy to work with in practice. The advent of kernel machines, such as Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Processes has opened the possibility of flexible models which are practical to work with. In this short tutorial we present the basic idea on how Gaussian Process models can be used to formulate a Bayesian framework for regression. We will focus on understanding the stochastic process and how it is used in supervised learning. Secondly, we will discuss practical matters regarding the role of hyperparameters in the covariance function, the marginal likelihood and the automatic Occam’s razor. For broader introductions to Gaussian processes, consult [1], [2]. 1 Gaussian Processes In this section we define Gaussian Processes and show how they can very naturally be used to define distributions over functions. In the following section we continue to show how this distribution is updated in the light of training examples. 1 By a parametric model, we here mean a model which during training “absorbs ” the information from the training data into the parameters; after training the data can be discarded.},

Following the threads of experimental writing from the present into the past, she shows how writers have long tested and transgressed technological boundaries.Reading the means of production as well as the creative works they produce, Emerson demonstrates that technologies are more than mere tools and that the interface is not a neutral border between writer and machine but is in fact a collaborative creative space. Reading Writing Interfaces begins with digital literature’s defiance of the alleged invisibility of ubiquitous computing and multitouch in the early twenty-first century and then looks back at the ideology of the user-friendly graphical user interface that emerged along with the Apple Macintosh computer of the 1980s. She considers poetic experiments with and against the strictures of the typewriter in the 1960s and 1970s and takes a fresh look at Emily Dickinson’s self-printing projects as a challenge to the coherence of the book.Through archival research, Emerson offers examples of how literary engagements with screen-based and print-based technologies have transformed reading and writing. She reveals the ways in which writers—from Emily Dickinson to Jason Nelson and Judd Morrissey—work with and against media interfaces to undermine the assumed transparency of conventional literary practice.},

	abstract = {No figure among the western Marxist theoreticians has loomed larger in the postwar period than Louis Althusser. A rebel against the Catholic tradition in which he was raised, Althusser studied philosophy and later joined both the faculty of the Ecole normal superieure and the French Communist Party in 1948. Viewed as a "structuralist Marxist," Althusser was as much admired for his independence of intellect as he was for his rigorous defense of Marx. The latter was best illustrated in For Marx (1965), and Reading Capital (1968). These works, along with Lenin and Philosophy (1971) had an enormous influence on the New Left of the 1960s and continues to influence modern Marxist scholarship. This classic work, which to date has sold more than 30,000 copies, covers the range of Louis Althusser's interests and contributions in philosophy, economics, psychology, aesthetics, and political science. Marx, in Althusser's view, was subject in his earlier writings to the ruling ideology of his day. Thus for Althusser, the interpretation of Marx involves a repudiation of all efforts to draw from Marx's early writings a view of Marx as a "humanist" and "historicist." Lenin and Philosophy also contains Althusser's essay on Lenin's study of Hegel; a major essay on the state, "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses," "Freud and Lacan: A letter on Art in Reply to André Daspre," and "Cremonini, Painter of the Abstract." The book opens with a 1968 interview in which Althusser discusses his personal, political, and intellectual history.},

The piece is, in fact, an extract from a much longer book, On the Reproduction of Capitalism, until now unavailable in English. Its publication makes possible a reappraisal of seminal Althusserian texts already available in English, their place in Althusser’s oeuvre and the relevance of his ideas for contemporary theory. On the Reproduction of Capitalism develops Althusser’s conception of historical materialism, outlining the conditions of reproduction in capitalist society and the revolutionary struggle for its overthrow. Written in the afterglow of May 1968, the text addresses a question that continues to haunt us today: in a society that proclaims its attachment to the ideals of liberty and equality, why do we witness the ever-renewed reproduction of relations of domination? Both a conceptually innovative text and a key theoretical tool for activists, On the Reproduction of Capitalism is an essential addition to the corpus of the twentieth-century Left.From the Trade Paperback edition.},

	shorttitle = {High {Tech} and {High} {Heels} in the {Global} {Economy}},
	abstract = {High Tech and High Heels in the Global Economy is an ethnography of globalization positioned at the intersection between political economy and cultural studies. Carla Freeman’s fieldwork in Barbados grounds the processes of transnational capitalism—production, consumption, and the crafting of modern identities—in the lives of Afro-Caribbean women working in a new high-tech industry called “informatics.” It places gender at the center of transnational analysis, and local Caribbean culture and history at the center of global studies.  Freeman examines the expansion of the global assembly line into the realm of computer-based work, and focuses specifically on the incorporation of young Barbadian women into these high-tech informatics jobs. As such, Caribbean women are seen as integral not simply to the workings of globalization but as helping to shape its very form. Through the enactment of “professionalism” in both appearances and labor practices, and by insisting that motherhood and work go hand in hand, they re-define the companies’ profile of “ideal” workers and create their own “pink-collar” identities. Through new modes of dress and imagemaking, the informatics workers seek to distinguish themselves from factory workers, and to achieve these new modes of consumption, they engage in a wide array of extra income earning activities. Freeman argues that for the new Barbadian pink-collar workers, the globalization of production cannot be viewed apart from the globalization of consumption. In doing so, she shows the connections between formal and informal economies, and challenges long-standing oppositions between first world consumers and third world producers, as well as white-collar and blue-collar labor.  Written in a style that allows the voices of the pink-collar workers to demonstrate the simultaneous burdens and pleasures of their work, High Tech and High Heels in the Global Economy will appeal to scholars and students in a wide range of disciplines, including anthropology, cultural studies, sociology, women’s studies, political economy, and Caribbean studies, as well as labor and postcolonial studies.},

What electricity and combustion engine were to the early 20th century, software is to the early 21st century. Offering the the first theoretical and historical account of software for media authoring and its effects on the practice and the very concept of 'media,' the author of The Language of New Media (2001) develops his own theory for this rapidly-growing, always-changing field.What was the thinking and motivations of people who in the 1960 and 1970s created concepts and practical techniques that underlie contemporary media software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, Final Cut and After Effects? How do their interfaces and tools shape the visual aesthetics of contemporary media and design? What happens to the idea of a 'medium' after previously media-specific tools have been simulated and extended in software? Is it still meaningful to talk about different mediums at all? Lev Manovich answers these questions and supports his theoretical arguments by detailed analysis of key media applications such as Photoshop and After Effects, popular web services such as Google Earth, and the projects in motion graphics, interactive environments, graphic design and architecture. Software Takes Command is a must for all practicing designers and media artists and scholars concerned with contemporary media.},

In the following paper the author interprets the OSI Reference Model as discussed in ISO/TC97/SC16/N227 and presents an overview of a formal definition of the Reference Model using a state-oriented system philosophy.

Tentative detailed refinements of the Model are discussed and comments on the implications of a formal model are included.},

	abstract = {Representation is central to contemporary theories regarding the mind/brain. But the nature of representation—both in the mind/brain and more generally—is a source of ongoing controversy. One way of categorizing representational types is to distinguish between the analog and the digital: the received view is that analog representations vary smoothly, while digital representations vary in a stepwise manner. In other words, 'digital' is synonymous with 'discrete', while 'analog' is synonymous with 'continuous'. I argue that this characterization is inadequate to account for the ways in which representation is (and should be) used in cognitive science; in its place, I suggest an alternative taxonomy. I will defend and extend David Lewis's account of analog and digital representation, distinguishing analog from continuous representation, as well as digital from discrete representation. I will argue that the distinctions available in this fourfold account better accord with representational features of interest in cognitive science than the received analog/digital dichotomy.},

The entire question of referentiality had to be recast in light of these new media technologies.

This paper presents the results of a nation-wide, two-wave, longitudinal investigation of the factors driving personal computer (PC) adoption in American homes. The findings revealed that the decisions driving adoption and non-adoption were significantly different. Adopters were driven by utilitarian outcomes, hedonic outcomes (i.e., fun), and social outcomes (i.e., status) from adoption. Non-adopters, on the other hand, were influenced primarily by rapid changes in technology and the consequent fear of obsolescence. A second wave of data collection conducted six months after the initial survey indicated an asymmetrical relationship between intent and behavior, with those who did not intend to adopt a PC following more closely with their intent than those who intended to adopt one. We present important implications for research on adoption of technologies in homes and the workplace, and also discuss challenges facing the PC industry.},

In her study of the state of modern humanity, Hannah Arendt considers humankind from the perspective of the actions of which it is capable. The problems Arendt identified then—diminishing human agency and political freedom, the paradox that as human powers increase through technological and humanistic inquiry, we are less equipped to control the consequences of our actions—continue to confront us today. This new edition, published to coincide with the fortieth anniversary of its original publication, contains an improved and expanded index and a new introduction by noted Arendt scholar Margaret Canovan which incisively analyzes the book's argument and examines its present relevance. A classic in political and social theory, The Human Condition is a work that has proved both timeless and perpetually timely.Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) was one of the leading social theorists in the United States. Her Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy and Love and Saint Augustine are also published by the University of Chicago Press.},

Pattern languages have been used in architectural design and urban planning to codify related rules-of-thumb for constructing vernacular buildings and towns. When applied to software design, pattern languages promote reuse while allowing novice designers to learn from the insights of experts. Dotplots have been used in biology to study similarity in genetic sequences. When applied to software, dotplots identify patterns that range in abstraction from the syntax of programming languages to the organizational uniformity of large, multicomponent systems. Dotplots are useful for design by successive abstraction—replacing duplicated code with macros, subroutines, or classes. Dotplots reveal a pervasive design pattern for simplifying algorithms by increasing the complexity of initialization. Dotplots also reveal patterns of wordiness in languages—one example Inspired a design pattern for a new programming language. In addition, dotplots of data associated with programs Identify dynamic usage patterns—one example identifies a design pattern used in the construction of a UNIX(tm) file system. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.Hooked is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products. Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior.Eyal provides readers with:• Practical insights to create user habits that stick.• Actionable steps for building products people love.• Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.},

Stephen Ramsay's intriguing study of computational text analysis examines how computers can be used as "reading machines" to open up entirely new possibilities for literary critics. Computer-based text analysis has been employed for the past several decades as a way of searching, collating, and indexing texts. Despite this, the digital revolution has not penetrated the core activity of literary studies: interpretive analysis of written texts. Computers can handle vast amounts of data, allowing for the comparison of texts in ways that were previously too overwhelming for individuals, but they may also assist in enhancing the entirely necessary role of subjectivity in critical interpretation. Reading Machines discusses the importance of this new form of text analysis conducted with the assistance of computers. Ramsay suggests that the rigidity of computation can be enlisted in the project of intuition, subjectivity, and play.},

Unfortunately, Cole's account manifests the same tensions and ambiguities as these original projects, and fails to live up to its revolutionary and integrative promise.

	abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church-Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the `universal quantum computer' are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

These new essays extend his investigations of the instability of the physical text. McGann shows how every text enters the world under socio-historical conditions that set the stage for a ceaseless process of textual development and mutation. Arguing that textuality is a matter of inscription and articulation, he explores texts as material and social phenomena, as particular kinds of acts. McGann links his study to contextual and institutional studies of literary works as they are generated over time by authors, editors, typographers, book designers, marketing planners, and other publishing agents. This enables him to examine issues of textual stability and instability in the arenas of textual production and reproduction. Drawing on literary examples from the past two centuries--including works by Byron, Blake, Morris, Yeats, Joyce, and especially Pound--McGann applies his theory to key problems facing anyone who studies texts and textuality.},

Mechanisms is the first book in                 its field to devote significant attention to storage--the hard drive in                 particular--arguing that understanding the affordances of storage devices is                 essential to understanding new media. Drawing a distinction between "forensic                 materiality" and "formal materiality," Kirschenbaum uses applied                 computer forensics techniques in his study of new media works. Just as the                 humanities discipline of textual studies examines books as physical objects and                 traces different variants of texts, computer forensics encourage us to perceive new                 media in terms of specific versions, platforms, systems, and devices. Kirschenbaum                 demonstrates these techniques in media-specific readings of three landmark works of                 new media and electronic literature, all from the formative era of personal                 computing: the interactive fiction game Mystery House, Michael Joyce's                 Afternoon: A Story, and William Gibson's electronic poem                 "Agrippa."},

	abstract = {This paper mainly focuses on the development of the NOR flash memory technology, with the aim of describing both the basic functionality of the memory cell used so far and the main cell architecture consolidated today. The NOR cell is basically a floating-gate MOS transistor, programmed by channel hot electron and erased by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. The main reliability issues, such as charge retention and endurance, are discussed, together with an understanding of the basic physical mechanisms responsible. Most of these considerations are also valid for the NAND cell, since it is based on the same concept of floating-gate MOS transistor. Furthermore, an insight into the multilevel approach, where two bits are stored in the same cell, is presented. In fact, the exploitation of the multilevel approach at each technology node allows an increase of the memory efficiency, almost doubling the density at the same chip size, enlarging the application range and reducing the cost per bit. Finally, NOR flash cell scaling issues are covered, pointing out the main challenges. Flash cell scaling has been demonstrated to be really possible and to be able to follow Moore's law down to the 130-nm technology generations. Technology development and consolidated know-how is expected to sustain the scaling trend down to 90- and 65-nm technology nodes. One of the crucial issues to be solved to allow cell scaling below the 65-nm node is the tunnel oxide thickness reduction, as tunnel thinning is limited by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms.},

The relationship between digital images and their encoded files, and in other cases, between digital images and the algorithms that generate them as display, lends itself to a conviction that the image and the file are mutually interchangeable. This relationship posits a connection of identicality between the file and the image according to which the mathematical basis and the image seem to share similar claims to truth. Since the history of images within Western culture is fraught with charges of deception and illusion, the question arises whether the ontological condition of the digital image, its very existence and identity, challenges this tradition. Or, by contrast, does the material instantiation of images, in their display or output, challenge the truth claims of the mathematically based digital file?},

Jockers introduces readers to large-scale literary computing and the revolutionary potential of macroanalysis--a new approach to the study of the literary record designed for probing the digital-textual world as it exists today, in digital form and in large quantities. Using computational analysis to retrieve key words, phrases, and linguistic patterns across thousands of texts in digital libraries, researchers can draw conclusions based on quantifiable evidence regarding how literary trends are employed over time, across periods, within regions, or within demographic groups, as well as how cultural, historical, and societal linkages may bind individual authors, texts, and genres into an aggregate literary culture. Moving beyond the limitations of literary interpretation based on the "close-reading" of individual works, Jockers describes how this new method of studying large collections of digital material can help us to better understand and contextualize the individual works within those collections.},

The authors' focus is on the why of network design, not just the specifications comprising today's systems but how key technologies and protocols actually work in the real world to solve specific problems. The new edition makes less use of computer code to explain protocols than earlier editions. Moreover, this new edition shifts the focus somewhat higher in the protocol stack where there is generally more innovative and exciting work going on at the application and session layers than at the link and physical layers.                                       * Completely updated with new sidebar discussions that cover the deployment status of protocols described in the book.* Addition of sizeable number of new exercises and solutions.* Downloadable Opnet network simulation software and lab experiments manual.* New and revised instructor support material, including Powerpoint slides, eps version of figures appearing in the text; sample exams; lecture notes; UNIX sockets programming assignments.},

	shorttitle = {Piracy},
	abstract = {Since the rise of Napster and other file sharing services in its wake, most of us have assumed that intellectual piracy is a product of the digital age and that it threatens creative expression as never before. The Motion Picture Association of America, for instance, claimed that in 2005 the film industry lost \$2.3 billion in revenue to piracy online. But here the author shows that piracy has a much longer and more vital history than we have realized, one that has been largely forgotten and is little understood. This work explores the intellectual property wars from the advent of print culture in the fifteenth century to the reign of the Internet in the twenty-first. Brimming with broader implications for today's debates over open access, fair use, free culture, and the like, this book ultimately argues that piracy has always stood at the center of our attempts to reconcile creativity and commerce, and that piracy has been an engine of social, technological, and intellectual innovations as often as it has been their adversary. The book swarms throughout with characters of genius, principle, cunning, and outright criminal intent. In the wars over piracy, it is the victims, from Charles Dickens to Bob Dylan, who have always been the best known, but the principal players, the pirates themselves, have long languished in obscurity. It is their stories especially that are brought to life in these pages. From Cervantes to Sonny Bono, from Maria Callas to Microsoft, from Grub Street to Google, no chapter in the story of piracy evades the author's analysis. "Piracy explores the intellectual property wars from the advent of print culture in the fifteenth century to the reign of the Internet in the twenty-first. Written with a historian's flair for narrative and sparkling detail, the book swarms throughout with characters of genius, principle, cunning, and outright criminal intent. In the wars over piracy, it is the victims - from Charles Dickens to Bob Dylan - who have always been the best known, but the principal players - the pirates themselves - have long languished in obscurity, and it is their stories especially that Johns brings to vivid life in these pages."--Jacket.},

In contrast, traditional cathode ray tubes (CRTs) emit light as very short pulses, which gives the CRT a better dynamic resolution. As a consequence, LCDs suffer from motion artifacts, which are visible as a blurring of moving objects. Based on a straightforward frequency domain analysis that takes into account the eye tracking of the viewer, we propose a method for reducing these artifacts. This method, `motion compensated inverse filtering', uses motion vectors to apply a pre-correction to the video data. As such, we are able to recover the sharpness of moving images on LCDs to a large extent.},

The fault, argues this ingenious—even liberating—book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Donald A. Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how—and why—some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.},

	abstract = {Is the Internet a vast arena of unrestricted communication and freely                 exchanged information or a regulated, highly structured virtual bureaucracy? In                 Protocol, Alexander Galloway argues that the founding principle of the Net is                 control, not freedom, and that the controlling power lies in the technical protocols                 that make network connections (and disconnections) possible. He does this by                 treating the computer as a textual medium that is based on a technological language,                 code. Code, he argues, can be subject to the same kind of cultural and literary                 analysis as any natural language; computer languages have their own syntax, grammar,                 communities, and cultures. Instead of relying on established theoretical approaches,                 Galloway finds a new way to write about digital media, drawing on his backgrounds in                 computer programming and critical theory. "Discipline-hopping is a necessity when it                 comes to complicated socio-technical topics like protocol," he writes in the                 preface.Galloway begins by examining the types of protocols that exist, including                 TCP/IP, DNS, and HTML. He then looks at examples of resistance and subversion --                 hackers, viruses, cyberfeminism, Internet art -- which he views as emblematic of the                 larger transformations now taking place within digital culture. Written for a                 nontechnical audience, Protocol serves as a necessary counterpoint to the wildly                 utopian visions of the Net that were so widespread in earlier days.},

These messy, photocopied do-it-yourself documents cover every imaginable subject matter and are loaded with handwriting, collage art, stickers, and glitter. Though they all reflect the personal style of the creators, they are also sites for constructing narratives, identities, and communities.Girl Zines is the first book-length exploration of this exciting movement. Alison Piepmeier argues that these quirky, personalized booklets are tangible examples of the ways that girls and women ‘do’ feminism today. The idiosyncratic, surprising, and savvy arguments and issues showcased in the forty-six images reproduced in the book provide a complex window into feminism’s future, where zinesters persistently and stubbornly carve out new spaces for what it means to be a revolutionary and a girl. Girl Zines takes zines seriously, asking what they can tell us about the inner lives of girls and women over the last twenty years.},

It also revises the notion of blending as proposed by Turner and Fauconnier and observes that blending obeys general constraints of cognitive economy and of consistency; more specifically, it is argued that blending responds to Lakoff's Invariance Principle, of which a slightly modified version is provided here and defined as the Extended Invariance principle. The Extended Invariance principle accounts for the possibility of preservation of all generic-level structure (not only image-schematic structure) in metaphoric mappings, and allows for the possibility of more than one input space in the mapping process. Finally, blended spaces are seen as one possible outcome of the activity of working memory, while the apparent conceptual irregularities and asymmetries which Turner and Fauconnier observe in their emergence are alternatively explained as contextual implications motivated by and derived from the convergence of information from different Idealized Cognitive Models (or ICMs) in the action part of productions.},

The effect of these independent developments was that similar services were often provided by quite different mechanisms, and interconnection became extremely difficult. Late in the 1970's a strong desire for a standard means of internetwork communication arose. It was realized that a common model of distributed data communications would be required to facilitate the development of these standards. Intensive activity was initiated by several national and international standards organizations, including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). In 1978 the “Reference Model of Open Systems Interconnection” [8] was produced, and this led to the 1981 Draft International Standard 7498 “Data Processing. Open Systems Interconnection - Basic Reference Model” [2]. The documents assume an environment of systems which make themselves “open” to the exchange of data with other systems by adhering to a well-defined set of standard procedures for communication. The documents scope includes not only the basic transfer of information between such systems, but also the capability of such systems to work together in support of distributed applications.},

When an appropriately high field is applied through an outer gate, the floating gate charges up.

Stored-charge density of the order of 1012/cm2 has been achieved and detected by a structure similar to an metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) field effect transistor. Such a device functions as a bistable memory with nondestructive read-out features. The memory holding time observed was longer than one hour.

	shorttitle = {Lexicon of the {Mouth}},
	abstract = {Lexicon of the Mouth surveys the oral cavity as the central channel by which self and surrounding are brought into relation. Questions of embodiment and agency, attachment and loss, incorporation and hunger, locution and the non-sensical are critically examined. In doing so, LaBelle emphasizes the mouth as a vital conduit for negotiating "the foundational narrative of proper speech." Lexicon of the Mouth aims for a viscous, poetic and resonant discourse of subjectivity, detailed through the "micro-oralities" of laughing and whispering, stuttering and reciting, eating and kissing, among others. The oral cavity is posed as an impressionable arena, susceptible to all types of material input, contamination and intervention, while also enabling powerful forms of resistance, attachment and conversation, as well as radical imagination.Lexicon of the Mouth argues for the revolutionary promise of the laugh, the spirited mythologies of the whisper, the schizophonics of self-talk, and the primal noise of gibberish, suggesting that the significance of voicing is fundamentally bound to the exertions of the mouth. Subsequently, assumptions around voice and vocality are unsettled in favor of an epistemology of the oral, highlighting the acts of the tongue, the lips and the throat as primary mediations between interior and exterior, social structures and embodied expressions. LaBelle makes a significant contribution to currents in sound and voice studies by reminding that to hear the voice, and to consider a politics of speech, is first and foremost to assume the mouth.},

Despite the fact that each discipline has a specific focus, there is also considerable overlap. Knowledge sharing, however, is becoming increasingly difficult as the body of knowledge in each discipline increases and specialization results. For effective knowledge sharing, it is therefore important to have a unified classification system by means of which the bodies of knowledge that constitute the field may be compared and contrasted. This paper presents a multi-faceted system based on five research-focused characteristics: topic, approach, method, unit of analysis, and reference discipline. The classification system was designed based on the requirements for effective classification systems, and was then used to investigate these five characteristics of research in the computing field.},

We further refine our approach by introducing a perceptual significance metric that allows us to weight the amount of processing performed on different regions in the image. In addition, we analyze the role of motion vector errors in the quality of our resulting image. Perceptual tests indicate that our algorithm reduces the amount of perceivable motion blur in LCDs.},

	abstract = {In 2004 the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, Chris Anderson, made the assumption that the Internet was bringing together scattered markets for cultural products that had not hitherto been lucrative due to their narrow market appeal. With sales of these products aggregated, he argued, they were now becoming profitable. This assumption, referred to as the "long tail," proved to be persuasive. It opened up prospective new markets for cultural goods, promoting the idea that online sales could increase cultural diversity. This article examines the initial research on the long tail assumption, drawing on the results of both published and unpublished works. It concludes that, despite the appeal of this argument, the data only partially support Anderson's assumption. En 2004, Chris Anderson, rédacteur en chef de la revue Wired, a émis l'hypothèse selon laquelle internet était en train de réunir des marchés dispersés pour des produits culturels qui jusqu'alors n'étaient pas lucratifs en raison de leur faible audience. Leurs ventes regroupées, ces produits devenaient rentables. Appelée « longue traîne » (long tail), cette hypothèse s'est avérée convaincante. Elle a ouvert de nouveaux marchés prometteurs pour les biens culturels, faisant valoir l'idée que les ventes en ligne pouvaient favoriser la diversité culturelle. L'article examine la recherche initiale sur l'hypothèse de la longue traîne en s'appuyant sur des travaux publiés et non publiés. Les auteurs concluent que, malgré l'attrait de l'argumentation, les données n'appuient que partiellement l'hypothèse d'Anderson. En 2004, el redactor en jefe de la revista Wired Magazine, Chris Anderson, supuso que la Internet estaba reuniendo mercados productos culturales dispersos que no habían sido lucrativos a causa de su limitada penetración al mercado. Argumentaba, sin embargo, que al estar reunidos empezaban a ser rentables. Esta suposición, conocida como la ”larga estela” parece haber sido persuasiva. Abrió nuevas perspectivas de mercado para bienes culturales, promoviendo la idea de que la venta en línea podría incrementar la diversidad cultural. Este artículo examina la investigación inicial sobre la hipótesis de la larga estela, basándose en los resultados publicados tanto como los que no lo han sido. Concluye qué, a pesar de lo atractivo que puede parecer este argumento, los datos recolectados solo sostienen parcialmente la hipótesis de Anderson.},

	abstract = {No judgement of taste is innocent. In a word, we are all snobs. Pierre Bourdieu brilliantly illuminates this situation of the middle class in the modern world. France's leading sociologist focusses here on the French bourgeoisie, its tastes and preferences. Distinction is at once a vast ethnography of contemporary France and a dissection of the bourgeois mind.In the course of everyday life people constantly choose between what they find aesthetically pleasing and what they consider tacky, merely trendy, or ugly. Bourdieu bases his study on surveys that took into account the multitude of social factors that play a part in a Frenchperson's choice of clothing, furniture, leisure activities, dinner menus for guests, and many other matters of taste. What emerges from his analysis is that social snobbery is everywhere in the bourgeois world. The different aesthetic choices people make are all distinctions-that is, choices made in opposition to those made by other classes. Taste is not pure. Bourdieu finds a world of social meaning in the decision to order bouillabaisse, in our contemporary cult of thinness, in the "California sports" such as jogging and cross-country skiing. The social world, he argues, functions simultaneously as a system of power relations and as a symbolic system in which minute distinctions of taste become the basis for social judgement.The topic of Bourdieu's book is a fascinating one: the strategies of social pretension are always curiously engaging. But the book is more than fascinating. It is a major contribution to current debates on the theory of culture and a challenge to the major theoretical schools in contemporary sociology.},

Based on theoretical considerations, it is proposed that by using the three “long tail technology drivers” to integrate individual knowledge into an organizational knowledge management system, individual and organizational knowledge can be utilized in a more efficient and effective manner.},

The author claims that verbal metaphors are not simply instantiations of temporary, ad hoc categories but reflect preexisting conceptual mappings in long-term memory that are metaphorically structured. Various evidence from cognitive linguistics, philosophy, and psychology are described in support of this claim. Evidence is also presented that supports, contrary to Glucksberg and Keysar's position, the role of tacit conceptual metaphors in the comprehension of verbal metaphors in discourse.},

These three forms of visual persistence are widely assumed to reflect a single underlying process: a decaying visual trace that (1) consists of afteractivity in the visual system, (2) is visible, and (3) is the source of visual information in experiments on decaying visual memory. It is argued here that this assumption is incorrect. Studies of visible persistence are reviewed; seven different techniques that have been used for investigating visible persistence are identified, and it is pointed out that numerous studies using a variety of techniques have demonstrated two fundamental properties of visible persistence: theinverse duration effect (the longer a stimulus lasts, the shorter is its persistence after stimulus offset) and theinverse intensity effect (the more intense the stimulus, the briefer its persistence). Only when stimuli are so intense as to produce afterimages do these two effects fail to occur. Work on neural persistences is briefly reviewed; such persistences exist at the photoreceptor level and at various stages in the visual pathways. It is proposed that visible persistence depends upon both of these types of neural persistence; furthermore, there must be an additional neural locus, since a purely stereoscopic (and hence cortical) form of visible persistence exists. It is argued that informational persistence is defined by the use of the partial report methods introduced by Averbach and Coriell (1961) and Sperling (1960), and the term “iconic memory” is used to describe this form of persistence. Several studies of the effects of stimulus duration and stimulus intensity upon the duration of iconic memory have been carried out. Their results demonstrate that the duration of iconic memory is not inversely related to stimulus duration or stimulus intensity. It follows that informational persistence or iconic memory cannot be identified with visible persistence, since they have fundamentally different properties. One implication of this claim that one cannot investigate iconic memory by tasks that require the subject to make phenomenological judgments about the duration of a visual display. In other words, the so-called “direct methods” for studying iconic memory do not provide information about iconic memory. Another implication is that iconic memory is not intimately tied to processes going on in the visual system (as visible persistence is); provided a stimulus is adequately legible, its physical parameters have little influence upon its iconic memory. The paper concludes by pointing out that there exists an alternative to the usual view of iconic memory as a precategorical sensory buffer. According to this alternative, iconic memory is post-categorical, occurring subsequent to stimulus identification. Here, stimulus identification is considered to be a rapid automatic process which does not require buffer storage, but which provides no information about episodic properties of a visual stimulus. Information about these physical stimulus properties must, in some way, be temporarily attached to a representation of the stimulus in semantic memory; and it is this temporarily attached physical information which constitutes iconic memory.},

	isbn = {978-0-231-12165-1},
	abstract = {Television is a form of media without equal. It has revolutionized the way we learn about and communicate with the world and has reinvented the way we experience ourselves and others. More than just cheap entertainment, TV is an undeniable component of our culture and contains many clues to who we are, what we value, and where we might be headed in the future.Media historian Gary R. Edgerton follows the technological developments and increasing cultural relevance of TV from its prehistory (before 1947) to the Network Era (1948-1975) and the Cable Era (1976-1994). He begins with the laying of the first telegraph line in 1844, which gave rise to the idea that images and sounds could be transmitted over long distances. He then considers the remodeling of television's look and purpose during World War II; the gender, racial, and ethnic components of its early broadcasts and audiences; its transformation of postwar America; and its function in the political life of the country. He talks of the birth of prime time and cable, the influence of innovators like Sylvester "Pat" Weaver, Roone Arledge, and Ted Turner, as well as television's entrance into the international market, describing the ascent of such programs as Dallas and The Cosby Show, and the impact these exports have had on transmitting American culture abroad. Edgerton concludes with a discerning look at our current Digital Era (1995-present) and the new forms of instantaneous communication that continue to change America's social, political, and economic landscape. Richly researched and engaging, Edgerton's history tracks television's growth into a convergent technology, a global industry, a social catalyst, a viable art form, and a complex and dynamic reflection of the American mind and character. It took only ten years for television to penetrate thirty-five million households, and by 1983, the average home kept their set on for more than seven hours a day. The Columbia History of American Television illuminates our complex relationship with this singular medium and provides historical and critical knowledge for understanding TV as a technology, an industry, an art form, and an institutional force.},

In it we find Derrida at work on his systematic deconstruction of Western metaphysics. The book's first half, which includes the celebrated essay on Descartes and Foucault, shows the development of Derrida's method of deconstruction. In these essays, Derrida demonstrates the traditional nature of some purportedly nontraditional currents of modern thought—one of his main targets being the way in which "structuralism" unwittingly repeats metaphysical concepts in its use of linguistic models.  The second half of the book contains some of Derrida's most compelling analyses of why and how metaphysical thinking must exclude writing from its conception of language, finally showing metaphysics to be constituted by this exclusion. These essays on Artaud, Freud, Bataille, Hegel, and Lévi-Strauss have served as introductions to Derrida's notions of writing and différence—the untranslatable formulation of a nonmetaphysical "concept" that does not exclude writing—for almost a generation of students of literature, philosophy, and psychoanalysis.  Writing and Difference reveals the unacknowledged program that makes thought itself possible. In analyzing the contradictions inherent in this program, Derrida foes on to develop new ways of thinking, reading, and writing,—new ways based on the most complete and rigorous understanding of the old ways. Scholars and students from all disciplines will find Writing and Difference an excellent introduction to perhaps the most challenging of contemporary French thinkers—challenging because Derrida questions thought as we know it.},

Whereas the abolition of the Islamic caliphate, closure of the medreses, and prohibition of the Sufi orders have received considerable attention in histories of early republican Turkey, the state-sponsored translation of the Qurʾan into Turkish remains both neglected and misunderstood. Muhammad Rashid Rida, who was highly influential in shaping opinion in the Muslim world, portrayed the state-sponsored project as a long-term plot to displace the Arabic Qurʾan. Other accounts misrepresent the involvement of President Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) in the promotion of Qurʾan translation by anachronistically suggesting that he sparked the initiative and led a “campaign” in support of it. Mustafa Kemal had no hand in the composition of Turkish Qurʾan translations published in 1924, other than helping create the political context in which they could be published. Their composition began well before the foundation of the Turkish republic, and their inspiration emerged from the intellectual milieu of the late Ottoman public sphere.},

Since the model had been published in 1984, this was in accordance with ISO practice of reviewing and revising standards every five years, and there was good reason for considering the task. Over the intervening five years, the groups developing the OSI protocols had raised many questions about the architecture and these had been answered and documented in the Approved Commentaries [1994]. Many of these commentaries contained information that could be usefully incorporated into the Reference Model itself. In addition, the addendum describing connectionless mode, i.e. datagrams, had been completed several years before and needed to be incorporated. There was also considerable demand for interworking connection-mode and connectionless mode communication, something not supported by the Reference Model or any architecture. Also, when the original version of the Reference Model was frozen about 1983 some aspects of OSI such as the upper layers were not well understood and were only described in the most cursory manner. And while connection-mode and connectionless mode had been brought within OSI, there was no indication as to how broadcast and multicast were to be handled. Thus, the revision might be able to provide a more comprehensive description of these areas.This paper describes how the revision was carried out, describes the changes and additions that were made, considers the effect and contribution this revision has made to our understanding, and describes the outstanding issues that were not addressed by this revision.},

We employ and discuss the limitations of a production function approach to relate investment inputs to scientific outputs using a sample of 14 countries for which we have information on higher education research and development (HERD). The outputs are taken from the Thomson ISIÂ® national science indicators (2002) database on published papers and citations. The inputs and outputs for this sample of countries have been recorded for a period of 21Â years (1981-2002). A thorough discussion of the data shortcomings is provided. On the basis of this panel dataset we investigate the profile of the time lag between investment in HERD and research output and returns to national investment in science. We devote particular attention to analysing the presence of cross-country spillovers. We show their relevance and underline the international effect of the US system.},

With these questions, the pioneering biophilosopher Jakob von Uexküll embarks on a remarkable exploration of the unique social and physical environments that individual animal species, as well as individuals within species, build and inhabit. This concept of the umwelt has become enormously important within posthumanist philosophy, influencing such figures as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Deleuze and Guattari, and, most recently, Giorgio Agamben, who has called Uexküll "a high point of modern antihumanism."A key document in the genealogy of posthumanist thought, A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans advances Uexküll's revolutionary belief that nonhuman perceptions must be accounted for in any biology worth its name; it also contains his arguments against natural selection as an adequate explanation for the present orientation of a species' morphology and behavior. A Theory of Meaning extends his thinking on the umwelt, while also identifying an overarching and perceptible unity in nature. Those coming to Uexküll's work for the first time will find that his concept of the umwelt holds out new possibilities for the terms of animality, life, and the whole framework of biopolitics itself.},

It is known that the motion blur is caused by the hold-type characteristics of LCD. The problem is improved with a double-rate driving method. In this method, it is necessary to insert the middle frame according to the motions by the objects. The middle frame is created using the frame interpolation technique with the motion estimation and the motion compensation. We proposed a robust hybrid method which consists of several kinds of interpolation method and verified that the hybrid method achieved high image quality by the subjective evaluation.},

Monitoring these events facilitates correlation between the structure of source/object code and the efficiency of the mapping of that code to the underlying architecture. This correlation has a variety of uses in performance analysis, including hand tuning, compiler optimization, debugging, benchmarking, monitoring, and performance modeling. In addition, it is hoped that this information will prove useful in the development of new compilation technology as well as in steering architectural development toward alleviating commonly occurring bottlenecks in high performance computing.},

Piracy has always posed a representational problem within contemporary discourses on law, public good and creativity. Piracy seems to allegorize an impure transgression, tainted by commerce and an inability to produce a discourse on itself. Pirate production of commodities and media objects fits neither a narrative of resistance nor normative critique, nor does piracy seem to fit received models of creativity or innovation. Piracy produces a series of anxieties: from states, transnational capital, and media industries and even within some liberal proponents of the public domain. The paper reframes the problem of the pirate through an examination of the content/ infrastructure binary, and questions existing assumptions about creativity, subjectivity and transformation, commodification and social life.},

Through unconventional modernist autobiographies, Victor Shklovsky's Zoo; or, Letters Not about Love and Third Factory, and Joseph Brodsky's "Less Than One" and "In a Room and a Half," the essay traces a cultural history of "estrangement"-from the avant-garde and formalist "art as a device" to a dissident art of survival. The exilic autobiographies offer a counterpoint to Benedict Anderson's analogy between the narrative of individual biography and the "imagined community" of a nation. The essay does not limit itself to the "poetics" of exile but looks at how the actual experience of exile revises writers' metaphors and creates a new bilingual consciousness-that of a prodigal son who never comes back.},

This is paper presents an algorithm which structurally recognises the text of a page image. The method is based upon the “Docstrum plot” algorithm by L.O'Gorman (1993). Modifications have been made to O'Gorman's algorithm which render very good results at identifying paragraphs and lines in particular. The algorithm implementation can, to a limited degree, describe the logical relationship of the text elements of the original page. The limitations of the algorithm are due to the lack of information available without OCR and font technology incorporated into the algorithm implementation. The algorithm implementation has a graphical interface which portrays the state of the algorithm during the process of decomposition},

We downloaded a set of 150 million Web pages on a weekly basis over the span of 11 weeks. We then determined which of these pages are near-duplicates of one another, and tracked how clusters of near-duplicate documents evolved over time. We found that 29.2\% of all Web pages are very similar to other pages, and that 22.2\% are virtually identical to other pages. We also found that clusters of near-duplicate documents are fairly stable: Two documents that are near-duplicates of one another are very likely to still be near-duplicates 10 weeks later. This result is of significant relevance to search engines: Web crawlers can be fairly confident that two pages that have been found to be near-duplicates of one another will continue to be so for the foreseeable future, and may thus decide to recrawl only one version of that page, or at least to lower the download priority of the other versions, thereby freeing up crawling resources that can be brought to bear more productively somewhere else.},

It is not a book that charts histories or genres of this emerging field, not a book setting out methods of reading and understanding. The Internet Unconscious is a book on the poetics of net writing, or more precisely on the subject of writing the net. By 'writing the net', Sandy Baldwin proposes three ways of analysis: 1) an understanding of the net as a loosely linked collocation of inscriptions, of writing practices and materials ranging from fundamental TCP/IP protocols to CAPTCHA and Facebook; 2) as a discursive field that codifies and organizes these practices and materials into text (and into textual practices of reading, archiving, etc.), and into an aesthetic institution of 'electronic literature'; and 3) as a project engaged by a subject, a commitment of the writers' body to the work of the net. The Internet Unconscious describes the poetics of the net's “becoming-literary,â€? by employing concepts that are both technically-specific and poetically-charged, providing a coherent and persuasive theory. The incorporation and projection of sites and technical protocols produces an uncanny displacement of the writer's body onto diverse part objects, and in turn to an intense and real inhabitation of the net through writing. The fundamental poetic situation of net writing is the phenomenology of “as-if.â€? Net writing involves construal of the world through the imaginary.?},

	isbn = {978-0-7456-6253-4},
	abstract = {Interfaces are back, or perhaps they never left. The familiar Socratic conceit from the Phaedrus, of communication as the process of writing directly on the soul of the other, has returned to center stage in today's discussions of culture and media. Indeed Western thought has long construed media as a grand choice between two kinds of interfaces. Following the optimistic path, media seamlessly interface self and other in a transparent and immediate connection. But, following the pessimistic path, media are the obstacles to direct communion, disintegrating self and other into misunderstanding and contradiction. In other words, media interfaces are either clear or complicated, either beautiful or deceptive, either already known or endlessly interpretable. Recognizing the limits of either path, Galloway charts an alternative course by considering the interface as an autonomous zone of aesthetic activity, guided by its own logic and its own ends: the interface effect. Rather than praising user-friendly interfaces that work well, or castigating those that work poorly, this book considers the unworkable nature of all interfaces, from windows and doors to screens and keyboards. Considered allegorically, such thresholds do not so much tell the story of their own operations but beckon outward into the realm of social and political life, and in so doing ask a question to which the political interpretation of interfaces is the only coherent answer. Grounded in philosophy and cultural theory and driven by close readings of video games, software, television, painting, and other images, Galloway seeks to explain the logic of digital culture through an analysis of its most emblematic and ubiquitous manifestation –  the interface.},

The same beam is utilized to detect and remove the charge at a later time. This paper describes the mode of operation of such tubes when used for storage of binary digital information. The sources of variation in the output signal are discussed. A basis is given for determining the probability of error due to amplifier noise. The storage capacity and program of operation are determined by the requirement of error-free performance. A discussion is included of data obtained from experimental tubes capable of storing 16,000 bits of information with reading or writing times of about one microsecond. A new type of target-reading circuit which is particularly suited to binary storage is also described.},

The first two parts of the article outline that both thinkers take the abstract universal to be the form of a false type of knowledge and society, and the concrete universal to be a positive aim. However, as the third part argues, Adorno rejects how the concrete universal is understood in Hegel’s philosophy and formulates a different conception of it. The fourth part questions if Adorno manages to overcome the problems he identifies in Hegel or whether they are inherent to the programme of dialectics both endorse.},

	abstract = {When we speak of clouds these days, it is as likely that we mean data clouds or network clouds as cumulus or stratus. In their sharing of the term, both kinds of clouds reveal an essential truth: that the natural world and the technological world are not so distinct. In The Marvelous Clouds, John Durham Peters argues that though we often think of media as environments, the reverse is just as true—environments are media. Peters defines media expansively as elements that compose the human world. Drawing from ideas implicit in media philosophy, Peters argues that media are more than carriers of messages: they are the very infrastructures combining nature and culture that allow human life to thrive.  Through an encyclopedic array of examples from the oceans to the skies, The Marvelous Clouds reveals the long prehistory of so-called new media. Digital media, Peters argues, are an extension of early practices tied to the establishment of civilization such as mastering fire, building calendars, reading the stars, creating language, and establishing religions. New media do not take us into uncharted waters, but rather confront us with the deepest and oldest questions of society and ecology: how to manage the relations people have with themselves, others, and the natural world. A wide-ranging meditation on the many means we have employed to cope with the struggles of existence—from navigation to farming, meteorology to Google—The Marvelous Clouds shows how media lie at the very heart of our interactions with the world around us.  Peters’s  book will not only change how we think about media but provide a new appreciation for the day-to-day foundations of life on earth that we so often take for granted.},

	abstract = {The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man is a 1962 book by Marshall McLuhan, in which he analyzes the effects of mass media, especially the printing press, on European culture and human consciousness. It popularized the term global village, which refers to the idea that mass communication allows a village-like mindset to apply to the entire world; and Gutenberg Galaxy, which we may regard today to refer to the accumulated body of recorded works of human art and knowledge, especially books.
McLuhan studies the emergence of what he calls Gutenberg Man, the subject produced by the change of consciousness wrought by the advent of the printed book. Apropos of his axiom, "The medium is the message," McLuhan argues that technologies are not simply inventions which people employ but are the means by which people are re-invented. The invention of movable type was the decisive moment in the change from a culture in which all the senses partook of a common interplay to a tyranny of the visual. He also argued that the development of the printing press led to the creation of nationalism, dualism, domination of rationalism, automatisation of scientific research, uniformation and standardisation of culture and alienation of individuals.
Movable type, with its ability to reproduce texts accurately and swiftly, extended the drive toward homogeneity and repeatability already in evidence in the emergence of perspectival art and the exigencies of the single "point of view". He writes:
the world of visual perspective is one of unified and homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of spoken words. So language was the last art to accept the visual logic of Gutenberg technology, and the first to rebound in the electric age.},

In Part I, we summarize the results of our inventory, and explore a series of basic choices that must be made in the course of measuring information and communication capacities. The most basic underlying assumptions behind our estimates include—among others—decisions about what is counted as (1) communication, (2) storage, and (3) computation; if technological capacities or consumption of information is measured; and if unique information is distinguished from duplicate information. We compare our methodological choices with different approaches taken in similar studies. The article shows how the particular question on the researcher’s mind, as well as the availability of source data has and will influence most of the methodological choices in different exercises.},
